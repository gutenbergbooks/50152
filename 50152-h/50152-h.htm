<h2>WRITER’S NOTE</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Neither</span> guide-book nor history nor
commercial estimate, this Book merely
attempts the much less laborious task
of handing on the instant effect produced
by that active, tangible quantity,
the Liverpool of the present day; and
its Writer has therefore been forced to
rely, almost as completely as its Illustrator,
upon the private reports of his
own senses rather than upon the books
and testimonies of other people. None
the less he has managed to incur a little
sheaf of debts, and these, although he
is unable to repay, he is anxious at least
to acknowledge. By far the greatest
measure of his gratitude is due, not for
the first time, to his friend Mr. John
Macleay&mdash;lacking whose suggestion the
Book would never have been begun&mdash;lacking
whose counsel it would, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
finished, have been even less adequate
than it now remains; but he desires as
well to offer his especial thanks to Professor
Ramsay Muir, who generously
permitted him to read certain chapters
of the recently published “History of
Liverpool” in proof; to Dr. E. W. Hope,
Liverpool’s Medical Officer of Health, for
courteous responses to various inquiries;
to Mr. G. T. Shaw (of the Liverpool
Athenæum), Mr. A. Chandler (of the
Mersey Docks and Harbour Board),
Mr. H. Lee Jones, Mr. T. Alwyn Lloyd,
and Mr. William Postlethwaite, all of
whom have provisioned him with much
more information than he has found it
possible to use. To them, and to all
those other creditors whose names have
not been mentioned but who may be
equally inclined to deplore the waste of
good material, he would protest that
their assistance might have had a more
commensurate practical result if only
they could have persuaded those implacable
niggards, space and time, to
imitate their eager liberality.</p>

<span class="s8 tall">THE RIVER</span></h2>

<h3 title="">§ 1.</h3>

<p class="noindent">That fine fellow (a Scotchman, I understand)
who so handsomely acknowledged
the thoughtfulness displayed by Providence
in “constraining the great rivers
of England to run in such convenient
proximity to the great towns” would
have found in Liverpool-on-the-Mersey an
altogether exceptional opportunity for
thanksgiving. For it is upon her River,
with a very singular completeness, that
the existence of this great, complex,
modern organism unanimously depends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Rob her of her duties as port and harbour,
and she becomes impossible. Other
duties, of course, she has: among the
labyrinths of effort which her million
people have created all about them, you
will find tobacco-factories, corn-mills,
soap-works, breweries, sugar-refineries,
and a dozen other quite flourishing
industrial exploits; but these, even if
they were not in large measure directly
derived from the River itself&mdash;the voice
of the River, so to say, announcing
itself in other dialects&mdash;are never really
fundamental. They could be plucked
away, as her famous Potteries were
plucked away at the opening of the
nineteenth century, as her Chemical
Works were plucked away some decades
later, without producing anything but
the mildest and most parochial of disturbances.
Certainly, there would be no
crisis: the great machine would still
throb equably, the procession of her continually
advancing life would still move
magnificently on. But if you rob her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
of her river-born attributes, you leave
her utterly dismantled. Let the river-estuary
silt up, as river-estuaries have
been known to do, as this one is
constantly endeavouring to do, and
the whole elaborate structure instantly
crumbles and subsides. In London there
are a score of Londons, in Glasgow a
dozen Glasgows; but here there is only
one Liverpool&mdash;Liverpool-on-the-Mersey.</p>

<p>That is the great fact of her life. And
its significance is chief, not merely because
Liverpool owes her actual existence
to the River, but also because the whole
quality, the “virtue,” of that existence
has been determined by the completeness
of the dependency. It is not simply that
it is upon this broadly curving estuary,
as upon some broadly curving scimitar,
that Liverpool has had wholly to rely in
slashing her way to the position she now
maintains; it is also (and, from our present
point of view, chiefly) that her
fidelity to that weapon has induced certain
habits of poise, of outlook, of ideal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
which are now her most essential characteristics.
The influence is disclosed, as
we shall see, in all manner of ways. It
drenches the local atmospheres, private,
social, civic, with a distinctive colour.
It is revealed in the nature of the men in
her streets, and in the nature of the streets
about the men. It is the deciding element
in that inherent spirit of the place
which those men and those streets at
once prefigure and evoke, and which it
is the main purpose of this book, with the
aid of those men and streets, to attempt
in some measure to enclose. Some of the
channels of the influence are direct and
obvious enough, others are indirect and
secret; and one of the more obvious and
one of the most secret are connected
with the fashion in which that dependence
has affected her history in the past.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 2.</h3>

<p>The incisive feature of that history is
the suddenness of the City’s emergence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
from a position of comparative obscurity
into one of supreme moment. All down
the ages, indeed, as the preparations for
its sept-centenary celebrations, with
which the place is ringing as I write, are
now making especially clear, people have
been clustered together on the river-bank,
testing the great weapon, shaping and
sharpening it, using it, as new issues and
battle-cries uprose, with a constantly increasing
forcefulness.<a name="Anchor_1" id="Anchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a> But it was not
until the later decades of the eighteenth
century that the real opportunity arrived.
It was among the alarums and
excursions of the amazing period which
then began, among its endless industrial
sallies and revolutions, its fabulous commercial
conquests, that the weapon was
for the first time granted the scope it
needed to swing with full effect. And
therefore it was within a space of extra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>ordinary
brevity&mdash;within the leaping
years of a single century, indeed&mdash;that
the City achieved its greatness, and assumed
the aspect which it wears to-day.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <dl>
     <dt><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" title="Return to text." href="#Anchor_1">[1]</a></dt>
     <dd>The details of these activities have been
set out more perfectly than ever before, and
with a union of concision and lucidity which it
is impossible to praise too highly, in Professor
Ramsay Muir’s recent “History of Liverpool.”
     </dd>
  </dl>
</div>

<p>The direct consequences of that are
obvious enough. Liverpool becomes,
quite frankly, an almost pure product of
the nineteenth century, a place empty of
memorials, a mere jungle of modern civic
apparatus. Its people are people who
have been precipitately gathered together
from north, from south, from overseas,
by a sudden impetuous call. Its
houses are houses, not merely of recent
birth, but pioneer houses, planted instantly
upon what, so brief a while ago,
was unflawed meadow-land and marsh.
Both socially and architecturally it becomes,
in large measure, a city without
ancestors.</p>

<p>That is sufficiently manifest. But
what is not so manifest, and what robs
these sept-centenary celebrations, these
pageants and retrospective ardours, of
any too great tincture of incongruity, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the fact that the River which has washed
these interior traditions and memorials
away has also restored them in another
place and form. It has established, at
the gates of the City, a far more perdurable
monument to antiquity than any
that architecture could contrive. For,
whilst they are not of the soil, these
people, they are all unmistakably of the
Mersey. They have discovered a kinship,
neither of blood nor of land, but
wholly vital and compelling, which binds
them not only with one another, but with
old ardours and forgotten years. The
wide plain of water that pours endlessly
about their wharves and piers colours
their lives as deeply as it coloured the
lives of those who watched its lapse before
them: consciously or unconsciously, they
acquire something of the ripeness that
comes from traffic with old and fateful
quantities. Thus, consciously or unconsciously,
they inevitably pass into vital
touch with the earlier wielders of the
weapon: with the dim fisher-folk who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
were its eldest users; with the cluster of
serfs who received their first “charter”
of privileges seven hundred years ago;
with the Irish traders of the seventeenth
century; with the slave-traders of the
eighteenth; with the merchants who
watched the dawn of the day of the last
great onset. The River becomes in this
way a kind of Cathedral, a place heavy
with traditions, full of the sense of old
passions.</p>

<p>This is clearly not the sort of influence
that one can measure with a foot-rule
or sum up in a syllogism; but in this
nuance of endeavour and in that, in
characteristics which it would be impossible
briefly to define, but which may
perhaps appear in the pages which follow,
the effect, I feel, is made faintly, delightfully
apparent. The sheer youth of the
place has been granted something of the
dignity of age. The audacities and
vigours of the century which gave it
birth have been tinged with a certain
gravity and largeness. The very force
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>which has made the place so superbly
youthful and athletic, so finely unhampered
by the rags of outworn modes, has
also granted it that intimate sense of
history, that heartening and annealing
influence of ancient ardours vitally and
romantically recalled, without which a
city, as a nation, is but an army without
music and banners.</p>

</div>

<p>And it is this complete dependence of
City upon River, too, which helps largely
to explain what are certainly the two main
paradoxes of her daily life: the fact that
she is of all cities at once the most heterogeneous
in composition, and in exposition
the most homogeneous; and the
fact, again, that her commercial interests
are extravagantly world-wide, and her
civic interests extraordinarily local. They
are characteristics, these two, which never
fail to attract the observer extremely&mdash;perhaps,
even, extremely to puzzle him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
He remarks the cosmopolitan population,
the nomadic life so many of them lead,
the disturbing flux and bustle of the
traveller-strewn pavements; and in face
of these things he discovers, to his huge
surprise, that the civic spirit of this variegated
and distracted junction is more
puissant and concerted than that of any
other city in the kingdom. He knows
that she is, in effect, little more than a
great gateway between West and East;
he knows that her merchants are chiefly
middlemen, that the prime function of
the place is to fetch and carry, to bring
from hither and forward there; and yet
he finds the whole affair looming up into
a stubborn Rodinesque independence,
achieving this and that original thing with
an unexpected air of finality, and maintaining
always an aloofness, a clear and
unmistakable individuality, that seems
utterly incongruous in the midst of the
involved world-movements swaying so
frantically about her.</p>

<p>Of the accuracy of his observation, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
all events, there is room for little question.
At every turn of the City’s social
and municipal life those two salient
antithetical characteristics are vividly
displayed. Liverpool is boldly different.
She possesses, it seems, a singular
faculty for moulding and co-ordinating.
The peoples of the world pour through
her streets, but they never interrupt
her energetic introspectiveness. Fragments
of this and that exotic race
remain; they settle down, they breed,
they pour their alien habits, their alien
modes of thought, speech, religion, into
the communal veins; but there is no perceptible
change. The same emphatic
lines of activity sweep on; the same
special type is faithfully reproduced....
Liverpool, it seems to me, is astonishingly
self-absorbed. It is her own problems
that chiefly interest her, and she has a
habit of solving these problems for herself
on self-invented lines. She has
striven to work out&mdash;she is, as we shall
see, still intently striving to work out&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
ways of her own devising, the salvation of
her proletariate. She has created a society
that is quite untinged by the colours of
the county. She has bred her local
school of painters. Her politics are a
strange sort of democratic conservatism.
She is more civic than national, and
the newspapers of this most cosmopolitan
of English towns tend to reflect the
movements of the City rather than the
movements of the nation. And yet,
she is not provincial. Manchester, her
nearest neighbour, has her finely national
<i>Guardian</i>, and touches the actual life of
the metropolis with a far greater intimacy
and frequency; and yet, of the two,
Manchester is clearly the more provincial.
For provinciality, after all, is but a subordination
to the metropolis, a reflection,
half deliberate, half unconscious, of the
life that goes on spontaneously at the
centre. Well, Liverpool would be spontaneous,
too. She will imitate no one,
not even London. She will be her own
metropolis. And those who have marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the clear efficiency of her designs, the
unique mingling of American alertness
and Lowland caution which colours the
spirit that lives behind her very positive
efforts, will admit that she has come
bewilderingly near success.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 4.</h3>

<p>Much of this unexpected loyalty to
certain salient attributes, unvarying and
individual, is due, no doubt, to the brevity
of the period in which her final
growth took place: the pressure and intensity
of the moment begot, of necessity,
a kind of concentrated civism. And
much of it, too, is due to a certain
physical peculiarity which it is perhaps
worth while remarking. The City and
the River, of course, have now become
a roaring avenue between the hemispheres;
but none the less, Liverpool, in
a certain narrow, internal sense, cannot
be regarded as other than side-tracked.
Unlike Manchester, she lies some distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
away from the great highways that link
north with south, and even to-day the
tradition of London’s remoteness still to
some extent adheres. This isolation&mdash;an
isolation that was felt very keenly in
the early days of her growth&mdash;must have
helped, in some measure, to breed that
spirit of independence and self-reliance.
She had to fight for herself. Her River
made her too strong to be crushed by the
disadvantage, and gave her more than all
the power she needed to transform that
initial weakness into a positive stimulus
to especially emphatic effort.</p>

<p>So the River reappears; and I like to
think that it is, in the end, to the influence
of that superbly dominating presence,
even more than to the influence of
these factors of concentrated growth and
isolated station, that the City’s paradoxically
assonant announcements are
to be attributed. It is, as we have seen,
the City’s <i>raison d’être</i>, the chief orderer
and distributer of her people’s vocations;
and in that way alone it interweaves class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
with class, provides merchant, clerk, seaman,
and dock-labourer with a common
unifying interest. But with this dictation
of tasks, with this provision of a
tangible <i>leit motiv</i> that runs through and
conjoins the efforts of several hundred
thousand workers, the co-ordinating influence
of the River can scarcely be believed
to end. As a controller of physique,
for instance, slowly reconciling disparities,
its effect must be incalculably potent.
It is a reservoir of tonic airs; it renews
and revivifies the common atmosphere;
it sets a crisp brine-tang in the heart of
every inhalation. Some kind of mental
and physical conformity, not easily to be
defined, but still remarkable, that democratic
sting quite conceivably creates;
and some kind of subtle solidarity, too,
must certainly result from the constant,
unforgettable presence of a piece of outer
Nature possessing so large a share of unremitting
loveliness. From the fierce
beauty of the River, indeed, there is no
possibility of escape: its scale is so vast;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
it thrusts itself so exultantly upon one.
It is not only the strange powers that
belong to moving waters that it exercises;
it trails with it as well, into the very core
of the City, a great attendant sweep of
unsullied and inviolable skyscape, and
burns great sunsets, evening after evening,
within full gaze of the town. The
imaginative effect of all this insistent
pageantry cannot, indeed, be easily overestimated.
And I certainly believe that
it is one of the great forces that weld this
diverse city-full into so curious a unanimity.</p>

<p>In view of all this vital domination of
the City by its River, there is something
singularly appropriate in the nature of
the first impression created by Liverpool
on the traveller who approaches her from
the sea. That first impression is, quite
inevitably, an impression of a great river
with a city vaguely and ineffectively at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>tached.
He has left New York, let us
say, a week before, and New York remains
on his memory as an intricate,
high-piled monument of stone and iron,
crowding upon and overshadowing the
waters of the Upper Bay. No such effect
of dominating human interests salutes
him as he steams up the river towards
New Brighton from the Bar. The south-swinging
curve of the coast hides the City
for a while, and for a while he sees
nothing but a long, low line of bourgeois
villas, sitting comfortably among the
sandhills on his left, and the great sky-snipping
lattice of the New Brighton
Tower rising, not inelegantly, ahead. The
houses on his left increase; Waterloo and
Seaforth shine pleasantly in the sun; and
from the base of the Tower, behind the
domed and glittering pier that swims
delicately out into the water from its
root, more bourgeois villas and a great
plenitude of white sea-promenades,
stretching away up the coast to Egremont,
up, beyond sight, to Seacombe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
carry out the note of mild watering-place
delights. It is all very charming, thinks
the visitor, but it doesn’t particularly
suggest any furious commercial maelstrom....
The town swings into foreshortened
vision, flat and docile beyond
the racing tide: a mild, smoke-softened,
wavering of roofs, a sporadic spire or so,
a dozen and a half of chimney-stalks, and
the dun cloud overhead&mdash;the constant
cloud that ought certainly to speak impressively
of industry, but that seems,
somehow, on the contrary, to mitigate all
the efforts (none of them very energetic)
that the City makes in the direction of
mass and lordliness. With the steep uprising
of the Seaforth battery comes the
first of the dumb grey miles of granite
that stretch up-river to the Stage. They
testify nothing to man’s sovereignty,
these great dock-walls; they seem&mdash;if,
indeed, they seem of human origin at all&mdash;no
more than an enforced defence-work;
and the quiet rigging discernible
behind them, and the funnels of a hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
liner, carry on that idea of the River’s
superior strength&mdash;a strength sufficient
to pass the grey barriers and create a
second kingdom in the plains beyond.
A couple of little towers, perched on
the wall, make pseudo-romantic notes&mdash;absent,
archaic, meaningless. A great
warehouse, four-square and stolid, with
blind eyes, is set heavily down like a dull
box&mdash;a box that may be full or empty,
but that is undoubtedly shut and locked,
whose key has undoubtedly been mislaid.
More warehouses, all equally immobile,
sullenly succeed it; and then the Landing-stage
itself, low and level and a trifle
dingy, begins to run humbly alongside,
spirting out at intervals a little squeal
of advertisement-begotten colour. And
still there is no resounding manifestation
from the City. The fretted tower of
St. Nicholas makes a neatly punctured
patch upon the sky; the Town Hall
Dome shows vaguely; there is an unexplained
glitter from the baseless crest
of the Royal Insurance Office. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
solitary building within sight that
swerves up with any unmistakable
authority is the building of the Mersey
Docks and Harbour Board.</p>

<p>And beneath, or beside, all this flatness
and domesticity, the Mersey itself reels
and swaggers splendidly. It is turgid
and tumultuous; its bustling highways
interlace alarmingly; there is a constant
shouting and hooting and dancing of
eager craft. Higher up-stream, the vast
salt lake of the Sloyne holds a brace of
liners, each, as it would seem, more massive
than the town; and a tall imperturbable
frigate sways graciously out
towards the sea, bursting into white sail-bloom
as she goes....</p>

<p>Nor, when he steps ashore, and climbs
up Water Street to the City’s hub, does
that effect of the River’s supremacy
utterly forsake him. Salt airs from the
sea pursue him; strange tongues salute
his ears; far-brought merchandise is
plucked hither and thither about him
as he goes. And even when he passes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
through the heart of the City and into the
suburbs beyond, and through the belt of
these into the open country that stretches
towards the east, the sting of the brine
will from time to time assault him, and
he will hear the endless crying of sea-birds,
and he will watch the grey, innumerable
gulls as they rise and fall
above the red wake of the plough.</p>

<p class="noindent">As Liverpool lies deployed upon the
South Lancashire landscape, she falls into
the shape of an all but fully unfurled fan.
The root bone-work of that fan, its unwebbed
handle-part, is formed by the
commercial apparatus of the place, the
municipal apparatus, and&mdash;pleasantly
conjoined to these hard masculine concerns&mdash;the
more feminine region of the
great shops, the flowers, the carriages,
the shopping women. All this has been
compactly tugged down towards its
central wharves by that inevitable arbiter
the River; it forms the area, busy
but uninhabited, which the traveller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
enters the moment he steps ashore. In
it are the streets of offices, the banks,
the various Exchanges&mdash;Cotton, Corn,
Produce, Stock&mdash;and occasional dense
masses of warehouses; all about these&mdash;a
pattern of dull jewels, say, on the grey
essential framework&mdash;there lie the great
official buildings&mdash;the Town Hall, the
Municipal Offices, St. George’s Hall,
the Art Gallery, and so forth&mdash;with here
and there, more vigorously flashing, the
glassy bulbs that tip the railways; and
there, finally&mdash;a series of decorative
flourishes&mdash;curve the bright ways of the
emporia. Next, to right and left of this
clean-picked fabric, appear, like two
swart brush-strokes, the twin quags of
the slums&mdash;their position, too, explicitly
defined by the River; and beyond these,
again, drooping down V-wise towards
the handle in the centre, but for the
rest holding consistently aloof, spread
the vast, indeterminate plumes of the
suburbs, curving round from the river-side
at Seaforth, away through the open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
country, and so back to the river-side at
Garston.</p>

<p>Thus, the whole congeries splits up, it
will be seen, rather more automatically
than is usual, into just those four great
divisions which every modern city is theoretically
supposed to display. Here and
there, of course, a divergency appears:
over at Linacre, for instance, a group
of industrial exploits&mdash;match-works,
dye-works, a tannery&mdash;have lunged out
towards the open, have tended to create
out there their own special circle of
suburb, their own little patch of slum.
Over at Garston, again, there is a somewhat
similar happening; and across the
River, on the shores of the Wirral Peninsula,
Birkenhead, with its Town Hall
and its Docks, makes an attempt to complete
that tangential impulse which the
River has interrupted. But, for the most
part, the two main facts in Liverpool’s
career&mdash;the precipitancy of her uprising
and the singleness of her purpose&mdash;have
served to make her adherence to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
basic plan a singularly faithful one;<a name="Anchor_2" id="Anchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a>
and I propose, therefore, to take advantage
of it in this book, dealing in
the third chapter with that central region
of shops and offices and civic architecture,
the formal van of the army; in the
fourth chapter with the plumes of the
fan, the skirmishing sweep of the suburbs;
and in the fifth with those dusky smears
of the underworld.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <dl>
    <dt><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2" href="#Anchor_2" title="Return to text.">[2]</a></dt>
    <dd>It is interesting to observe that in this, as
in so many other matters (the strength of her
civic spirit, for instance; the nature of her
municipal exploits; the conspicuous attention
she is giving to the specifically urban problem
of the Housing of the Poor; her constant devotion
to the specifically urban business of locomotion),
the abnormal circumstances of Liverpool’s
growth have made her an unusually
faithful embodiment of certain of the most
essential of modern urban impulses. She is,
as I have said, boldly different; and it is of the
body of that difference that she should be thus
clearly representative: there being nothing, in
actuality, quite so exceptional as the typical.
On the one hand, that is to say, she is exceptional
because she is typical; on the other, she
is typical because she is exceptional.</dd>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>But before I approach even the first
of these, there remains yet another region,
perhaps more memorable, certainly more
remarkable, than them all: that queer
specialized region of the Docks, the most
extensive thing of its kind in the world,
which runs all along the littoral, from
Dingle in the south to Seaforth in the
north, sustaining, both pictorially and
essentially, practically the whole of that
great fan of masonry, making a kind of
long entrenchment, behind which the
army of the City is drawn up: the
elaborately forged handle, really, which
Liverpool has constructed in order that
she may grip her weapon more effectively.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 2.</h3>

<p>It is a region, this seven-mile sequence
of granite-lipped lagoons, which is invested,
as may be supposed, with some
conspicuous properties of romance; and
yet its romance is never of just that
quality which one might perhaps expect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
It is not here, certainly, in spite of the
coming and going of great ships, and the
aching appeal of brine, that the mind is
moved to any deep sense of kinship with
the folk who wielded the river-weapon
in old days. The place is as modern as
the town, as purged of traditions as the
town, and the drama that goes on here
is one that has never been enacted in
the world before. Its effectiveness,
indeed (I do not now speak of its efficiency),
is a thing that aligns with no
preconceived notions of effectiveness.
Neither of the land nor of the sea, but
possessing almost in excess both the
stability of the one and the constant flux
of the other&mdash;too immense, too filled with
the vastness of the outer, to carry any
sense of human handicraft&mdash;this strange
territory of the Docks seems, indeed, to
form a kind of fifth element, a place
charged with daemonic issues and daemonic
silences, where men move like
puzzled slaves, fretting under orders they
cannot understand, fumbling with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
forces that have long passed out of their
control....</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="image_dock_board_from_albert" id="image_dock_board_from_albert"><img src="images/dock_board_from_albert.jpg" alt="Dock Board Offices from the Albert Dock" title="Dock Board Offices from the Albert Dock" /></a>
    <p class="caption">

</div>

<p>That, certainly, is the first impression&mdash;an
impression that has nothing whatever
to do with the romance of commerce
or the ingenuity of man, or anything of
that kind, but that is simply the effect
of the unhuman spaciousness of it all,
the strangely quiet, strangely patient
presence of great ships, the vast leaning
shadows, the smooth imprisoned waters,
the slow white movements of a sea-bird
gravely dipping and curving, dipping and
curving, between the shadow and the
sun, the sudden emergence in the midst
of this solemnity of some great fever of
monstrous echoing activity. Afterwards,
of course, as the senses grow accustomed
to the new order of things, to the frightening
spaciousness and the bursts of tangled
effort, there ensues another attitude.
Names catch the eye: Naples, Hong-Kong,
Para; and the imagination gets its practised
opportunity. The sudden activities,
too&mdash;the clustered, wrangling cranes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>perched on their high roofs, and pecking
tirelessly; the bound, leaning carcass of
the ship below them, bleeding from a
score of wounds, the cranes about her
own masts adding to the riot; the long
sheds, ringing with echoes, dappled with
tiny figures delving in a long ruin of all
the goods of the world&mdash;they begin to
affect the mind more intimately. You
find yourself in the shadow of some slab
hill of cotton-bales, or peering up the
slopes of a swelling cone of grain, a
sibilant alp of gold, and you begin to
envision the anæmic spinster who will
one day wrap herself in some part of
that sodden mound, or the white hen,
in some dreamful farmyard, that will
one day peck this grain.... Or you
come down to the Docks after nightfall,
passing out of the greasy silence of the
northern streets, under the terrace of
the Overhead Railway, and so through
the gates behind the Huskisson. The air
is troubled with a soft sustained groaning:
the <i>Saxonia</i> (let us say) is at her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>berth discharging. She arrived from
Boston on Thursday, she will sail again
on Tuesday, and every instant, day and
night, that soft moaning will continue.
And that direful sound, and the torment
of labour going forward, in a shower of
green light, beneath the vague riven
masses of the liner, serve somehow to
drive you on to thoughts concerning
Liverpool’s efficiency and tirelessness,
concerning the bigness of her interests.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 3.</h3>

<p>And gradually, too, the system of the
labyrinth begins to emerge. That first
period of bewilderment, of bewilderment
that was almost fear, when you crept
along narrow shelves running between
dead water and warehouse wall, and
watched the vistas unfolding, some
gloomy, some naked, some clotted with
ships as a mill-dam is clotted with drift-wood;
when you crossed bridge after
bridge, from granite islands to granite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>mainland, and heard the wailful voices
of men coming desperately out of the
distances, and decided with a sickening
sense of despair that the whole thing had
swollen utterly out of hand, that those
ships would never be extricated, those
giant forces never recaptured&mdash;that bewilderment
is followed by the certainty
that specific things will always be going
on in specific places, and that the whole
litter of events is really made up of two
or three constantly recurring happenings.
It becomes plain, for instance, that in
one branch of the Huskisson you will
always find the brick-red and black
funnels of the Cunarders, and in another
the cream and black of the White Star.
You learn, again, that in the Wellington
one or other of Glynn’s boats will always
be unloading grain from the Danube, that
cotton from the Brazils and india-rubber
from the Amazon will always be found
in the sheds beside the Queens, and
grapes and wines from Spain in the next
dock to that, and rice from Calcutta over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
in the Toxteth. An austere elevator in
the Coburg insists on the constant attendance
of grain-barges; a mustard-coloured
stain on the rim of the Harrington
stands for cotton-seed meal from Galveston;
silver-hulled coasters, their spars
and rigging hanging in tender meshes
against the blue, fill the quiet reaches of
the Salthouse; and in the cloisters surrounding
the sunless quadrangle of the
Waterloo, men are always moving, as
Mr. Hay has painted them, in a deep
warm tumult of golden dusk. One-seventh
of all the ships in the world, it
is true, laden with fabulous loot, are
driven along these intricate waterways,
are penned in these monstrous interwoven
cells; and one-third of all the
goods the Kingdom receives, one-fourth
of all the goods she sends away, pass
through these great sheds and cumber
these endless quays. But those vast
herds, charging so wonderfully across the
plains of the Seven Seas, hold here for
the end of their flight a space that is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>measured by inches; and you may, therefore,
in spite of its enormity, map out the
whole labyrinth in your mind either chromatically
or topographically, either by
the names of companies or in terms of
grapes and silks and dyes and precious
ores, just as your temperament inclines.</p>

<h3 title="">§ 4.</h3>

<p>But however neatly familiarity may
thus label the place and tie it up into
little packages of effort, that first sense
of the superhumanity of the drama going
on here never for an instant lightens.
The actors employed, whether the liners
themselves, or the gaunt roof-cranes, or
the dire monsters that effect the coaling,
or the deliberate jaws of the dock-gates,
are designed on so immensely loftier a
scale than the rather draggled humans
who run to and fro in their shadows,
watched by the great silences, that they
inevitably upraise the expectations to
their own gigantic measure. Only in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
one brief corner of this seven-mile harbourage
is it possible to return once more
to the intimate human romance, the
traditional drama, of harbours and sea-traffickings.
It is a little basin between
the Coburg Dock and the Brunswick
Half Tide, and there, for a little while
longer, beneath an old-world quay, brown
sails dip softly in a quiet haven. Fishermen
sit and smoke above them, nets
hang in the sun, low buildings with
broken, domestic roofs run round a
cobbled square; and in one corner a
pier-master’s cottage has its ivy, its curtains,
its canary in a wicker cage. It is
a relic that serves only to italicize the
change. A pace to the right of it, a
pace to the left, the new world of draggled
humans and unhuman gestures is awaiting
one: a world where the blues of those
jerseys, the warm browns of those sails,
have faded into the sad blues and yellows
of mechanics’ overalls. From the cyclopean
platform of granite, frowned upon
by a cirque of raw cliff, and patterned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
with the shaggy heads and shoulders of
half-embedded liners, which lies at one
end of the chain, through all the rigid
convolutions of honey-coloured water
which lead to the interminable clangour
of the Atlantic berths at the other, it is a
place, invariably, where a new relation
has been established between man and
the outer seas. It is in hieroglyphs of
granite and water, in monstrous shapes
and silences, that the bare-handed individual
and the naked element make their
communications; and in the face of this
terrible script it is not strange that the
writer should be forgotten. The efficiency
of Liverpool, yes; but never, quite,
the efficiency of the people of Liverpool.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 5.</h3>

<p>I went down the other evening, for
instance, to see the <i>Baltic</i> and the <i>Campania</i>
come in to their berths. They
had both arrived that morning from
New York, they had landed their <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>passengers
and their mails at the Stage,
and all afternoon they had been lying
in mid-stream, two steep-shored islands,
with the ferry-boats passing beneath
them and silver clouds of gulls ranging
about their coasts. And now, the tide
being at the full, they had awakened
wonderfully to life, and were moving
processionally down the flood. A brace
of tugs marched at the head of each, one
a little to starboard, one to port, and in
the wake of each another tug nodded
and dipped.</p>

<p>It was a grey evening; a cold wind
pressed upon the tide, slats of rain broke
upon the surface. But the sight of that
pageant out there in the stillness warmed
the grey as with fire. It stirred the
heart like music; it was as elemental in
appeal as music. It fingered a new
range of emotions, untouched by the
doings of men. It was a progress as
brave and unhuman as the progress of
clouds across the sky.</p>

<p>The great moment came when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
curved slowly about in the dusk, and
began to move imperturbably across the
flood to where the head-light of our pier
upheld a cold gleam against the grey.
The wind beat about them as they advanced,
flurries of rain beset them, but
neither the wind nor the rain, nor the
racing tide, nor the narrowness of the
granite-guarded opening they had to
enter, seemed in the least to trouble
that impassive progress. And then they
were upon the gap, and the sheer walls
were crushing about their flanks, and a
vague tumult of sounds drifted down the
air, and so they passed through, with a
kind of contemptuous precision, into the
dead reaches beyond. One admired, one
marvelled, but it was never the admiration
one gives to human things. That
vague drift of sound, the dim peering
faces away up there on the bridge, the
little group of men running with a rope
along the quay&mdash;they all seemed quite
irrelevant&mdash;little happenings to which
the lordly shapes remained profoundly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
indifferent. It was to them, to those
lordly shapes, that the homage went out;
theirs was the courage and the beauty
and the wise strength. And when one
lighted porthole, and then another, revealed
rooms filled with living people,
it became scarcely possible to resist a
cry. The monster, after all, beneath this
impassivity, was really crammed and
feverish with some dreadful parasitic
life.... It is a sensation not dissimilar
to that which one gets when,
standing in Hyde Park on some clear
spring morning, one surveys the far
landscape rising and falling away in the
east, and then suddenly realizes with
a stound that all that palely gleaming
country-side is riddled with caverns enclosing
living men.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 6.</h3>

<p>After the starkness and rigour of the
Docks, the Landing Stage itself, the
half-mile raft, moored to the City’s gates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
which forms their centre-piece, presents a
somewhat dilettante appearance, almost,
indeed, a sentimental. It certainly makes
amends, at any rate, for the absence of
the human note in the theatre that
stretches away at either end of it. Half
of Liverpool uses it as a matter of
business, the other half as a matter
of health and pleasure, and it presents
all day long the appearance of a democratic
promenade. It is, in fact, the
finest of Liverpool’s parks, furnished
with its sheet of water, provided with its
cafés, its bookstalls, its seats. Merchants
and clerks from the contiguous bone-part
of the fan slip down here at lunch-time,
mothers bring their children from
the recesses of the suburban plume. The
actual people of Liverpool are here at
last to be seen in vital conjunction with
the weapon they employ. All that is
vivid in the movements of great waters
is made into a bright piece of their
lives, a familiar picture on the walls of
their living-room. A breeze is blowing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
maybe, and all the wide surface is curded
and laced with foam. The foam makes
a silver lattice up which the golden roses
of the morning climb and burn. The
scent of their blooming has coloured the
dreams of the ages.</p>

<p>Nor is even the utilitarian, the northern,
end of the Stage, where the great liners,
the <i>Baltics</i> and <i>Campanias</i>, discharge
and accept their passengers and mails,
altogether free from that effect of festival.
The mass of the steamer blots
out the sky, indeed, and it is thus in a
cistern of shade that the actual leave-takings
are effected and the baggage
plucked aboard. But there is always so
much of briskness, of white-handed briskness,
of silks and uniforms and an active
sociability, that the gloom becomes a
positive aid to the drawing-room sparkle
of it all. Deep amongst those monstrous
shapes and silences at the Docks all the
real effort has gone forward&mdash;the loading,
the coaling, even the embarkation of the
emigrants&mdash;and having suffered that in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>secret, the liner simply plays the part
of stolid protector of intimacies. The
human drama is never very obvious:
there are more tears and tension at any
of the great railway-stations; and although
the actual severance of the ship
from its moorings&mdash;breaking away, as it
seems from a distance, like a solid lump
of the land&mdash;does make some restoration
of that unhuman drama of elemental
quantities, the massed, fluttering handkerchiefs,
the lines of upturned faces by
the water’s edge, keep the moment intimate
and gallant.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="caption">
       THE LUCANIA.
   </p>
</div>

<p>More of the real emotion of distance,
of destinies astonishingly contravened,
belongs to the instant of the steamer’s
arrival. The naked fact of the departure
is always somewhat misted, and the last
severance gradually prepared for, by the
way the process extends: the steamer
protects the Stage for an hour or so, the
nerves are habituated. But the incoming
of the liner is a different matter. It is
a smear in the sky, it is a neatly pencilled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>apparition, it is a towering event in the
River, it is a vast door barring out the
west, all in the briefest space of time:
from start to climax the event leaps up
through a swift crescendo of incident,
and the little figures trooping an instant
later over the high gangways that are
really bridges from New York to London
have a fine aura of adventure. To see
all this accomplished in some evening of
amber and emerald, with the lights unfolding
like pale flowers on the far-drawn
violet shores, is to get another
vision of the world’s possibilities of beauty
and romance.</p>

<span class="s8 tall">THE CITY</span></h2>

<h3 title="">§ 1.</h3>

<p class="noindent">How to set about conveying the sense
of this great mass of minutely reticulated
architecture without instantly
growing too pedantic on the one hand
or too vaguely general on the other&mdash;that
is the problem&mdash;always, in this
business of civic portraiture, a very present
one&mdash;that now begins to grow
especially insistent. For the Docks, after
all, in spite of their unhuman magnitude,
do resolve themselves, as we have
seen, into a fairly compact cycle of
recurrences; and the Suburbs, again, unfolding
themselves in their order, do provide
a clear and vital method of attack;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>and the Slums, unhappily, cling loyally
throughout to one dolorous code. But
here, in this imposing van of the civic
army, there is neither loyalty to sole
effect nor specific rotation of several
effects. Each building is more or less
deeply individualized; every street has
its especial quality; and about the bases
of all these fretted cliffs, down all these
changeful ravines, the mutable tides of
the traffic charge and ebb unceasingly....
How is the sense of all these innumerable
aspects going to be squeezed
into a pitiful couple of thousand
words?...</p>

<p>One would like, for example, to distinguish
street from street: to speak of
Lord Street, say, with its inevitable air
of well-groomed alertness, brisk and
personable even under gloom, its rather
superficial architecture pleasantly asnap,
its traffic and its shops equally avoiding
the dully commercial, equally achieving
a confident glitter that only just falls
short of a swagger. One would like to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>contrast it with one of the ways that
branch out from it&mdash;with North John
Street, for instance, bleak-faced and
sombre, constantly resonant with heavy
traffic from the Docks, but made suddenly
magnificent by the rocketting
cream and gold of the foreshortened
Royal Insurance building at its head;
or with Whitechapel, again&mdash;a street,
for all its proximity, of so profoundly
different a quality: a street that seems
always to be attempting to override, by
dint of cheap cafés, clothiers, boot-shops,
and the like, the coarse utilitarian
note that insists on lumbrously
emerging from Crosshall Street, from
Stanley Street, from the neighbouring
clangorous Goods depots: a country
tripper of a street, shamefacedly endeavouring
to conceal the presence of
its obviously autochthonous companions.</p>

<p>And one would like, again, to speak of
Stanley Street itself, chief of those
autochthonous companions, a narrow
and difficult ravine, mostly sunless, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>always
noisy, whose bed is encumbered
from end to end with floats and lorries
and waiting carters, and whose walls are
provision offices, provision warehouses,
and the sheer grey flanks of the G.P.O.
From a gash in those grey flanks a
blood-red stream of post-office vans and
motors is jerked out intermittently. The
air is thick with swinging boxes and
heavy or keen with the most astounding
range of odours: with slab cheesy
odours and searching fruity ones; with
exotic odours that one sniffs uncertainly,
for which one can find no closer definition
than nice or nasty; and, supereminently,
running through them all, the
wild decivilizing smell of wet deal cases&mdash;a
smell that always arouses a certain
unemotional cotton-broker of one’s acquaintance
to an inconvenient but
rather touching hunger for some particular
place of dim forest silences.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="image_bold_street" id="image_bold_street"><img src="images/bold_street.jpg" alt="Bold Street" title="Bold Street" /></a>
    <p class="caption">
       BOLD STREET.
    </p>
</div>

<p>And then one would like to appraise
the elusive atmosphere of Bold Street&mdash;that
intimate, elegant avenue of rare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>fabrics and shopping women and the
ripe, drumming ripple of automobiles&mdash;the
Bond Street of Liverpool, whose
wood pavements make a sudden chosen
silence in the midst of the clatter, which
is held beautifully inviolate from electric
cars and sandwichmen, and at the head
of whose discreet vista the tower of
St. Luke’s rises gravely up, faintly remindful
of the manner in which the
towers of Sainte Gudule survey that
other road of women and priceless elegancies
in Brussels. And with this so
purely feminine apartment one would
proceed to contrast, properly enough,
some such exclusively male possession
as Brunswick Street. It, too, is highly
chosen and conserved, and the sober,
archaic front of the old Heywood’s Bank
at the upper end of it prepares one at
the outset for exactly the unostentatious
sobriety of the lower, where it passes
under the influence of the Corn Exchange.
It seems to reflect, and the
brokers one meets there seem <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>exceptionally
to reflect as well, something of
the spirit of that fine race of merchants
who wore leathern watchguards but
stocked a most excellent port, whose
word was good for thousands and who
lunched at the little tavern which still
stands there, like an old-fashioned waiter,
with so engaging an air of homely dignity.</p>

<p>And it would be impossible, of course,
to avoid comparing Brunswick Street
with that other exclusively masculine
quarter, Victoria Street, which passes,
in spite of its consistent virility, through
three successive phases. In the first,
where it lies between North John Street
and the Post Office, it has an almost
Stanley Street-like aspect&mdash;a wider and
less viscid Stanley Street, with the red
stream of mail-vans exchanged for a
black swarm of clerks and merchants,
hiving about the Produce Exchange.
In the second it grows aridly official,
the fidgety pomp of the Post Office
towering away on the right, the Revenue
Offices marching with much cold grey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>dignity on the left. And, finally, in its
third phase, it grows positively dramatic
and unintentionally spectacular: the
offices of the town’s protagonistic newspapers,
the <i>Post</i> and the <i>Courier</i>, confront
one another threatfully&mdash;silent at sunset,
but romantically vociferous towards
dawn, and, from close beside them, one
gets (especially on a morning of sunshine)
the most delightful glimpse of the
entirely noble sweep of architecture that
rises up&mdash;dreaming, reduced, subtile&mdash;beyond
the quick, green flash that sings
out from among the statuary of St. John’s
Gardens.</p>

<p>And so one could go on, disengaging
the essential spirit of street after street,
hoping that all the readings, taken together,
would build up into the gross
effect of the whole thing, would cleanly
spell out the essential spirit of the City.
As, indeed, they no doubt would. But
in the way of the adoption of that course
there lies one rather serious objection.
To make its final result veracious, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>would have to be followed with uncompromising
thoroughness; and if it were
followed with uncompromising thoroughness
this chapter would never end.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 2.</h3>

<p>So, then, although it carries us a certain
distance, that bundle of street
analyses, even if it were considerably
enlarged, must not be looked upon as
final. The alternative method, of course,
is the eclectic&mdash;a searching out of
“notes,” of the vistas, the groupings,
the buildings, that leap incisively out
from the mass and engage the memory&mdash;an
arrangement of these things in some
considered order.</p>

<p>And to such a collection that bunch
of street-portraits (their subjects, to be
frank, having been chosen rather less
off-handedly than might appear) forms
an admirable nucleus. And since it is
at the moments of arrival and departure
that the nerves are most sensitive to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
aspects&mdash;since it is, in consequence, the
first or the last glimpse of a place that
remains, for most of us, its practical,
portable symbol&mdash;the collection should
next include a note of the way Liverpool
reveals herself at each of her four great
vestibules&mdash;at the Landing Stage, at the
Exchange Station, at Lime Street Station,
at the Central Station.</p>

<p>From within the railings that fringe
the tiny courtyard outside the last, for
instance, it is as a neatly compacted
vista of twinkling shops, of converging
roofs, minarets, and flag-poles,
that, in the day-time, she rather alluringly
presents herself. There is much
delicate cross-hatching of shade and
shine, much blithe gold-lettering on
the walls. There are flower-sellers on
the kerb, a string of hansoms glisten
in the roadway, an electric car, double-decked
and yellow, surges down the
hill from Ranelagh Street and provides
the due top-note.... Emphatically,
a most efficient place, this Liverpool,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>glossy and high-stepping, at once elegant
and active. And with nightfall it
emerges as a place of quite exceptional
loveliness. That checked curve of the
receding buildings, giving the prospect
depth without diminution, grades the
lights without disparting them, knits
them together, both the near and the far,
into one exquisitely modulated chorus.
Moon-green, mistletoe-white, orange,
amethyst, and pearl, are their principal
colours, and in this chamber of converging
lines the massed clusters branch and
leap and linger with the most wonderful
effect of tender ardency.... Emphatically,
a place, this Liverpool, possessing
very singular possibilities of beauty.</p>

<p>The Liverpool that awaits one outside
the orifices that lead from Exchange
Station, however, is of a vastly different
quality.<a name="Anchor_3" id="Anchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a> Roofed with a remote, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>unimportant
sky, floored (say) with a
vague shimmer from recent rain, and
hung monotonously about with carefully
unobtrusive buildings, it seems less like
one of the central spaces of the City than
a mere ante-chamber to rooms&mdash;possibly
magnificent, possibly squalid&mdash;that
lie somewhere beyond; and in the mornings,
when the hosts from the northern
suburbs are pouring silently through,
that effect is irresistibly emphasized. It
is all neutral, non-committal. The solitary
stains of colour are the hoardings
that flame up before the Moorfields entrance,
and the immemorial fruit-barrow
that picks out against the grey in
Bixteth Street.</p>

    <dd>I speak here of what always seems to me
to be its most characteristic moment. That it
should sometimes be profoundly different, that
it should often present itself, for example, as a
prolonged splutter of lorries fighting up from
the Docks&mdash;agitated enough, then, in all conscience,
and daubed with much raw colour&mdash;is
but a testimony to that baffling mutability
which seems, in this matter, to make capture
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vraie vérité</i> even more impossible than
usual.</dd>

<p>One’s impression of the Lime Street
Liverpool, again, is always tinged by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
consciousness of that superb stretch of
“smutted Greek,” Liverpool’s most deliberate
effort in the direction of sustained
architectural spectacle, which one
sees just the moment before or just the
moment after. Without that consciousness,
the flat-chested, multi-windowed,
watery-complexioned hotels that droop,
perhaps a little dismally, down the hill
opposite, and the uncertain traffic that
spreads itself thinly out upon the vast
road-spaces in between, would probably
not convince one that their claim to
dignity was extraordinary. But as it is,
they do seem to catch a kind of magnificence,
a magnificence that is positively
almost shared by the little ragged sentry-box
of the Punch and Judy show set oddly
down, like a grandfather’s clock, plump
in the middle distance&mdash;a queer axis for
the cars that curve clangorously about
it. As one advances, the black chine of
St. George’s Hall, a long grey ripple
of steps lapping its base, thrusts forward
more and more emphatically, and so one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>passes into sight of that plateau of
classicism&mdash;St. George’s Hall, the Museum,
the Library, the Walker Art
Gallery, which Mr. Hay has described so
perfectly upon <a href="#image_walker_art" title="The Walker Art Gallery">another page</a>.</p>

<p>Deliberately majestical here, gravely
featureless in Tithebarn Street, elegant
from the Central, Liverpool achieves
within the last of her four porticoes an
order of effects more urgent and memorable
still. For it is behind the Landing
Stage that many of the car routes of
the City terminate, and the great space
of unshadowed roadway, empty of all
buildings save the new-sprung Dock
Offices, is really a brave platform on
which the cars endlessly wheel and interlace.
By daylight it is wonderful enough:
the long files of maroon and yellow
monsters curving, separating, recoiling;
the constant scream and clangour of
their onset; the rich white bulk of the
Dock Board building floating serenely
above the press. But towards evening,
when every car becomes a great cresset
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>of prisoned flame, the golden plenty of
it all, the intricate splendour of this
vast terrace of racing and receding fire,
is a thing to leave the senses glutted and
overborne. Liverpool is no longer a
place of architecture, grave or dignified.
It is a mere spectacle, a piece of golden
pageantry. And even the beauty of the
dominating building, ivory and pale rose
as it accepts the sunset, luminous and
firm-bodied as an eastern cloud at the
end of a day of wind, seems no more than
a fit accessory to the fabric of woven
lights astir below.</p>

<h3 title="">§ 3.</h3>

<p>It is one or other of those vignettes
that stands for Liverpool in the minds
of all but all those who live without her
walls; but there still remains another
touch or two to add before the symbol
we are attempting to create can be called
completed, before this inevitable, initial
slab of what must begin to appear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>uncommonly like sheer “word-painting”
(crude word for a cruder occupation)
can be brought to a close. Already
we have taken the sense of a group of
her central ways; already we have surprised
her at each of her four great doorways.
It now remains to brush in a
connecting note or two, an episode or
so from the less formal interspaces:</p>

<p>An appreciation, say, of one of those
admirable fortalice-like structures, the
warehouses, which clamp all the lower
end of the mass and convert the little
connecting roadways into canyons of
sumptuous gloom. Four-square and massive,
they are always shapely; the old
stock brick, hand-made, of which so
many of them are built, gives them a fine
hunger for ripe colouring; and from their
vertical lines of doorways&mdash;six, eight,
ten, a dozen, of them superimposed in
a slot that runs from roof to base&mdash;they
gain the power to charge their austerity
with something very near to positive
elegance....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>
<p>A reference to one other of the connecting
ways: thin sabre wounds of
light drawn across the dense body of
offices&mdash;to such a one as Leather Lane,
for instance, slipping stealthily from
Tithebarn Street to Dale Street, a sun-bright
tremor of traffic, dainty and
diminished as an image in a lens,
flickering delicately across its outlet....</p>

<p>An impression of some such typical
grouping of the mobile and the architectural
as one gets, say, at the top of
one of the three parallel ways&mdash;Chapel
Street, Water Street, James Street&mdash;which
run down from the centre towards
the River: a crawling steep of men, cars,
carriages, and drays; the flags and signs
of a horde of shipping offices accompanying
its descent; slow masts and a couple
of great funnels moving seriously beyond.
Or of such another grouping as
one finds being repeated, over and over
again, at the base of the brown stone curtain
that falls from St. Nicholas’ Churchyard
to the street below: a troop of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>sandwichmen, their beat ended, piling
their placards against the wall; a couple
of ramping Clydesdales&mdash;head-chains
glinting, feet asplay for purchase&mdash;taking
the Chapel Street hill; an aproned carter
swinking at their heads; a white-flecked
mound of cotton-bales lurching stolidly
at their heels; high over all, sailing
equably against the blue, the fretted top-gallant
of the Church....</p>

<p>A memorandum of one of the older
(not the old&mdash;there are none) scraps of
the City, pushed a little to one side,
antiquated before they are antique:
of that jolly little pot-bellied barber’s
shop at the foot of Mount Pleasant (Mr.
Hay has <a href="#image_little_shop" title="The Little Shop">described that</a>, too), and of how
the slick new mass of the juxtaposed
University Club crushes it into insignificance&mdash;a
ready-made metaphor; or
of that delightful Georgian residence in
Wolstenholme Square, not far from Bold
Street, with lorries clattering about
its mild old cobbles, and a trio of
extremely dirty tinsmiths bullying a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
carter from the top of its dignified
stairway....</p>

       THE LITTLE SHOP, MOUNT PLEASANT.
    </p>
</div>

<p>An appreciation of that tumultuary
roofscape one surveys from the steps of
the Art Gallery, a thing to be seen against
the afterglow, a clean-verged, leaping
monochrome of mauve on chrysoprase....</p>

<p>And there you have the main letters
in the alphabet of masonry which Liverpool
uses to write out some part of her
confessions.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 4.</h3>

<p>Now, it may be observed that I
have made no reference whatever to
some of the most conspicuous majuscules
in that alphabet. I have said nothing,
for instance, about the Municipal Offices,
nor of the Town Hall, nor of the Sailors’
Home, nor of the new Cotton Exchange,
nor of the old Custom House, nor of a
dozen other much-photographed architectural
plums. This is not laxity, nor a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>sudden dearth of adjectives, nor a disgust
with the business of scene-painting.
There is, as they say, a reason; and if
I disclose that reason, the confessions
which those dropped capitals bestud
may tend to grow more legible. Such
disclosure might serve, at all events, to
suggest a co-ordinating theory, to provide
a kind of zoetrope into which those
detached impressions and Mr. Hay’s
pictures may equally be fitted, and which,
judiciously twirled, may induce them all
to swim into a single animate and breathing
image.</p>

<p>The fact is, then, that when Liverpool
desires most to impress she expresses
least. When she draws herself together
for a splendid outburst, she grows inarticulate.
Her considered effects are
mostly affectations. So that to pick out
those effects, to arrange all the majuscules
together, is not merely to print her confession
in another type: it is to print a
confession of another type. One omits
these deliberate, self-consciously <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>impressive
things from one’s notes, not
because Liverpool contains very little
of such things, but rather because such
things contain very little of Liverpool.</p>

</div>

<p>For the spirit behind this fabric is
essentially a spirit absorbed in other
matters than the deliberate, preconsidered
capture of the beautiful.... Out of the
several characteristics we have already
noted&mdash;the swiftness of the City’s growth,
its glittering modernity, its tireless, deft
adjustment of alien activities to a common
end, its tenacious efficiency and
alertness&mdash;out of these things in conjunction
does there not already begin
to emerge (we are all invincible anthropomorphists
in these matters) some kind
of quite consistent Personality&mdash;the
genius of the place, if you will&mdash;the
handy embodiment, at any rate, of the
main instincts which this specially environed
congeries has tended to throw
into exceptional relief? For myself, I
see it always as a blunt Rodinesque
figure, sternly thewed, tensely poised,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>strenuously individual, tenacious of the
actual, impatient of mere dreams, energetic
rather than adventurous, a lover,
above everything, of efficiency&mdash;efficiency,
testing and twisting things with
earnest, untiring fingers, whittling things
down to the valid, irreducible core....
It is not from fingers like those that one
looks to receive many frail white images
of beauty. And whether this reading of
the essential psychology of the place be
true or false, it is certain that the men of
Liverpool have never been overprone to
sheer æstheticism. The vivid day of
their City has been crammed with leaping
episodes, it has left no spare strength for
flourishes, and they have expressed themselves
throughout in terms of a naked
and practical utility. Such purely
decorative effects as have from time to
time been judiciously introduced become
in consequence effects which it is vastly
easy to misunderstand. Take, for instance,
that lordly plateau-load of classical
furniture at Lime Street&mdash;a feature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>that would seem utterly to contradict,
but that in reality beautifully confirms,
this non-æsthetic reading of the City’s
nature. Raking among the ruins of the
place a thousand years hence, when
steamships are unknown and the Mersey
is silted up, some earnest archæologist
will come upon those (in both senses of
the word) imposing remains, and will
promptly be deceived. He will speak
with rapture of the “sharp bright edge
of high Hellenic culture” that must have
glittered about the community which
could produce such stately monuments;
and he will probably have a good deal
to say about the civic decadence of his
contemporaries. But archæology (not,
perhaps, for the first time) will have
been mistaken. These clean-limbed
columns and great porticoes and pediments
were not upreared by a race of
Phryne-worshipping hedonists. Directly
regarded, therefore, they are misleading,
uncharacteristic; but in an indirect way
they are very characteristic indeed. One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>would ask for no better proof of a man’s
lack of native appetite for literature
than that he had read through, in turn,
the whole of the hundred best books.
Similarly, this wholesale, uncompromising
adoption of an architectural mode already
traditional, already innumerable times
approved, is a most convincing proof of
the existence of that spirit of honest and
tenacious practical efficiency of which I
have spoken. When it came to a matter
of beauty, they made beauty a business,
they captured it by brute strength and
logic. There was nothing tentative, experimental,
about the effort; there was
no attempt at realizing some splendid,
unprecedented dream; line for line, mass
for mass, it was the stolid, efficient reproduction
of masses and lines about whose
loveliness there was no possibility of
question. And so the beautiful sequence
of buildings which stands for Liverpool’s
most deliberate piece of architectural
æstheticism is really a testimony to the
beauty-disregarding spirit of naked <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>utilitarianism
which her endless and imminent
activities have made inevitable.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 5.</h3>

<p>And it is precisely to this beauty-disregarding
spirit of utilitarianism again
that one traces some of the most memorable
and significant pieces of beauty that
the place possesses&mdash;more memorable
and significant than the St. George’s
Hall group, because vastly more vital and
characteristic. For Liverpool, in spite
of herself, and quite unconsciously, is a
place of exceeding beauty. Out of that
hard turmoil of tangible interests and
endeavours a very splendid and reassuring
happening has sprung. In honest
and shrewd response to instant necessities,
the city has been carved and
kneaded into the lean lines of practical
effectiveness; and those lines have joined
wonderfully together to make any number
of unpremeditated glories. Loveliness
has descended unawares. Built frankly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>for use, it seems to have attained, by
processes almost as organic as those of
outer nature, a very singular and moving
impressiveness. That drama of leaping
roof-tops seen from the Walker Art
Gallery, that chamber of co-ordinated
lights seen from the Central Station, that
racing flood of gold beneath the Dock
Board building, are examples of the sort
of thing I mean. It is in these natural
and instinctive creations, frankly utilitarian,
and not in her self-conscious
trafficking with loveliness, that Liverpool
grows most sensuously magnificent. A
curve of sunless canal with clustered
chimneys rising solemnly about; a pit
of railway sidings, warehouses ranged
round, one proud white plume of smoke
moving slowly across it; long glittering
reaches at the Docks; a black stretch of
suburb crawling out, myriad-speared,
across the sunset; a mass of warehouses
blotting out the stars; hot vistas in the
markets, ripe and fierce with colour;
burning evening skies, unintentionally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>clipped and framed by the pillars of the
Town Hall portico; roof-adjusted rods
of sunlight creating unexpected carnivals;
perspectives forming and vanishing; great
horses moving in procession; swift, imperative
assonances&mdash;momentary, irrecoverable&mdash;between
traffic and grouped
buildings: these and a thousand others
of the same spontaneous kind are the
passages of her life, the native gestures,
that linger in the memory like a cadence,
that colour her aspect with an abiding
dignity and graciousness.</p>

    </p>
</div>

<p>And this is, after all, to say little more
than that Liverpool possesses in deep
measure that strange accidental beauty
of the modern city which is a thing so
new to the world that the arts have
not yet learned to teach men how to
enjoy it. But in Liverpool (exceptional,
once more, because typical, typical because
exceptional) that beauty exists in
a state of singular purity. It is a beauty
that is the result, above everything, of a
naked response in stone and iron to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>certain clear imperative necessities: such
a response catching, as it would seem,
some of the beauty and authority that
inevitably attach to every articulate
expression of a vital impulse. And in
Liverpool those responses have been
especially clean and unentangled. The
place is self-contained: it has never run
to booths and show-places; it has no
associations, romantic or historic, to
attract the gaper; it has never had to
sustain a pose, and only rarely been
tempted to attempt one; and these
facts, and the fact that its growth has
been continuous, that there has nowhere
been any shrinkage or debilitation, have
made it possible for the garment of
buildings to be fitted to the authentic
body of its energies with an absolute
closeness and integrity. There are no
loose folds, no adaptations, very few
adhesive insincerities. The whole thing
is supremely vital and athletic; and
therefore it everywhere discloses that
strong and moving graciousness, as yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>almost wholly uncelebrated, which is as
elemental and unaffected as the strong,
forthright graciousness of its River.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 6.</h3>

<p>Thus far I have spoken chiefly of the
setting of this central stage, its scenery
and back-cloths. Let me now attempt
to indicate, as uninvidiously as may be,
one or two of the more prominent actors:
themselves, of course, equally symptomatic,
equally the choice and the mouthpiece
of that Rodinesque <i>deus ex machina</i>
couched invisibly behind.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="image_st_nicholas" id="image_st_nicholas"><img src="images/st_nicholas.jpg" alt="St. Nicholas and the Last of Tower Buildings" title="St. Nicholas Church and the Last of Tower Buildings" /></a>

    </p>
</div>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place aux dames</i>, by all means.... Of
the maturer actresses, however, I confess
I speak with a certain degree of diffidence.
It is always dangerous to generalize on
such a topic, and when the generalization
inclines to be not wholly laudatory, to the
danger of being guilty of inaccuracy is
added that of floundering into blank discourtesy.
But I will have, at least, the
courage of my impressions. Sifting them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>I incline to suggest that the more mature
of the women-folk whom one discerns
here, among the central shops&mdash;driving,
walking, shopping&mdash;seem somehow not
wholly to succeed. The efforts of an
earlier day seem to have left their marks&mdash;sometimes
in a certain exiguity, more
often in a certain inexiguity; and, facially,
one rather deplores the absence of anything
in the nature of that enduring
patrician basis which sometimes makes
(as one seems to remember) the inevitable
touches of attrition touches almost to
be welcomed&mdash;touches that refine, clarify,
take distinction a delicate step further.
Here and there, in a Bold Street carriage,
or in some one of the more guarded
roadways of the south-eastern suburbs,
a silvery face will flash out with a cameo-like
precision; but their incidence is
rare&mdash;quite rare enough, it seems to me,
to be accepted as significant. The general
note wavers instead between something
almost touchingly <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fade</i> and something
too tenacious of qualities which, however
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>charming in themselves, have rather lost
their personal propriety.... So one
hesitatingly generalizes. For the rest,
there is an infinitude of kindliness; and
one suspects that it would sometimes
much prefer to break away, more often
than it has the right to do, into frankest
homeliness. One is never tempted to
deplore a too vulgar display of mere
culture.</p>

<p>But of the younger of the female
players I speak with a notable access
of assurance. There, beyond question,
do I seem to detect the presence of a
very distinct type, and (still more reassuring)
of a type that is vastly pleasant.
More, I have, for the first part at least
of this judgment, the confirmation of a
friend in whose <i>flair</i> for social qualities
I repose, for the best of reasons, the most
absolute confidence. “I can tell them
anywhere, anywhere,” she assures me:
in Paris, at Nice, in Scotland, it seems,
the Liverpool <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeune fille</i> stands apart.
To the latter part of my judgment, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>is true, she subscribes only an assent
that is dimmed by a vague qualification
or so, perhaps not wholly inexplicable.
She hints, for one thing, at a kind of
gaucherie; but that, I am convinced, is
unfair. One may suggest, indeed, not
without justice, a certain lack of finesse,
but that is by no means the same thing.
Gaucherie implies a kind of inefficiency,
an inadequacy that trends towards clumsiness,
and anything short of an absolute
efficiency is flatly uncharacteristic of the
sort of girl I mean. Whether she speaks
or walks, buys a hat or wears one, plays
golf or the piano, it is always the consummate
apportionment of means to
end that most impresses one; and if one
rarely finds her indulging in the frailer,
more elusive, artifices of femininity&mdash;in
those so alluringly deliquescent touches of
speech, voice, emotion, gesture, and so
forth&mdash;in all the subtle craft of implication,
for instance&mdash;it is by no means
because her methods stumble before they
reach her ideals, but simply because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>her ideals include none of those fine,
diaphanous practices. Her vision of
the world is as distinct and sharp as
Mr. Bernard Shaw’s (Mr. Shaw, indeed,
would unreservedly admire her); her
emotions are robustious and definite;
and she makes all this instantly quite
clear, even to the outsider, in her
manner of speaking to her coachman as
she steps into her brougham, or in the
strong delicacy of the colours with which
she so charmingly and undisguisedly
emphasizes the clear colour of her eyes.</p>

<p>I grow intimate, it will be perceived,
and, in order to grow more intimate still,
let me appoint a flesh-and-blood heroine.
She is a woman who always seems to
me perfectly to achieve exactly what her
sister-players, one in this way, one in
that, succeed in attaining only approximately.
She certainly, at any rate,
perfects and epitomizes, in the most
delightful fashion, what one singles out
as their main tendencies&mdash;their main
physical tendencies, that is, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>therefore,
no doubt, their main sub-physical
tendencies as well. She is tall and large-limbed,
more Hebe than Diana, with
the grace of swiftness rather than of
languor, and a mode of gowning that
deals directly with the body’s needs, and
so, the body being so admirably fashioned,
immensely rejoices the eye. Bronze and
rose (here one inevitably tends toward
dithyramb; but these Liverpool complexions,
too good to be untrue, are
really quite memorable) meet distractingly
in her face’s colouring, and I will
not deny an occasional freckle or so.
She speaks an English that is clean and
well picked in a voice that is so satisfied
that it needs all its firmness to keep it
from complacency, and she has no discoverable
accent. She lives at Sefton
Park in one of the rather ineffective
houses we will criticize in the next
chapter, and, as often as not, comes to
town by electric car. (London, I hear,
still looks askance at its County Council
cars, but in Liverpool they are, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>always have been, quite the thing.) She
is most herself when she walks. Her
stride is not evasive. Golf has helped
to solidify it. She writes a most excellent
letter, reads a good deal, cares
nothing for Mr. Yeats, a great deal for
Tolstoi, is (rather unexpectedly) a
devotee of Bach, and can play the Chaconne
very vividly. She is at once
shrewd and tender, cool-headed and
warm-hearted. And although she protests
that she has “a soul above self-coloured
papers,” her regard for sacred
things, on the one hand, is as free from
sickliness as her regard for secular things,
on the other, is free from crudity and
ill-taste.</p>

<p>She stands, then, that highly satisfactory
young animal, for all that, in their
several ways, the majority of the younger
women-folk tend to rival; not only those
who pass from brougham to shop in
the clear morning brightness of Church
Street and Bold Street, but also those
others, even more truly native to these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>central quarters, whom one observes
hurrying here a few hours earlier, and
leaving, with something more of leisureliness,
in the neighbourhood of six and
seven: the less fortunate, but scarcely
less reassuring sisterhood whose business
it is to wait at the thither end of that
passage from brougham to shop, and
produce such hats, ribbons, laces, flowers,
as our heroine may desire. Physically,
indeed, these shop-girls of Liverpool have
a charm that rather astonishes the
stranger; and they, too, are remarkably
efficient self-gowners. To pass down
Lord Street and Church Street on some
spring evening, with the ebbing daylight
tactfully erasing any of the lines the stress
of the long, close hours may have left
on the young faces, and the flowering
lights of the City flinging little splashes
of piquancy among them, is to be
charmed into accepting the physical
beauty of women as one of the especial
attributes of these rapid commercial
streets.</p>

<div>
<h3 title="">§ 7.</h3>

<p>As for the male members of the company,
they avow, of course, an unusually
complete immersion in occupations unmuscular
and theoretical: Liverpool’s
exceptional freedom from industrialism&mdash;other
than the secluded industrialism of
the Docks&mdash;making her, in this conspicuous
white-fingered urbanity of her
workers, once more especially typical
of one of the chief modes of modern
civic life. All manual labour being,
broadly speaking, tidily banished to the
Docks, these central spaces are left entirely
at the disposal of the dock-labourer’s
soft-handed collaborators&mdash;the
clerk, the merchant, the broker. Every
morning, from nine to ten, the tide of
these spruce actors pours astonishingly in.
They cram and encrust the cars, they
traverse, with a neat, fashionable air,
that mild ante-room in Tithebarn Street;
they flood thickly up from the River&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>an
agreeably apparelled army that gives
a fine air of prosperity to all the streets,
and that will shortly settle down, in a
thousand unseen cells, to its extraordinary
and so modern labours, dealing always
with symbols instead of actualities, with
signatures instead of people, with bills
of lading instead of bales and boxes,
flinging tons of merchandise from continent
to continent with the flick of a pen&mdash;a
queer, Shalott-like existence of whispers
and reflections.</p>

<p>But in spite of these unmuscular rites,
and in spite of those elegant costumes, it
must not be imagined that the ritualists
are themselves unmuscular. It is by no
means a white-faced and dyspeptic clan,
this clerical tribe of Liverpool. And,
for my own part, I like to believe that it
is the River once more which has secured
for these clerks, merchants, bankers,
brokers, their rather conspicuous emancipation
from the proverbial physical
defects of the sedentary. The place,
anyhow, is very clearly pledged to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>athleticism, as those rows of physical
culture magazines which chromatically
tessellate the pavements of Water Street
and Chapel Street would alone suffice
to make quite evident. And certainly,
even if it be not wholly responsible for
this remorseless pursuit of muscularity,
the River gives that pursuit all manner of
exceptional advantages. The long series
of famous golf-links that lie amongst the
sand-dunes at New Brighton, at Leasowe,
at Hoylake, at Formby, at Blundellsands,
at Birkdale; the numerous salt-water
swimming-baths; the sailing clubs;
the briny, gale-cleansed spaces of aromatic
gold, free to all who care to use them,
that curve endlessly about the coast;
the mere proximity of the Landing Stage
and the presence of the cordial and
bracing airs that enfilade the streets of
offices behind it&mdash;all these things must
have tended to give athleticism an
especial point and vigour. The River has
made one-half of Liverpool a race of
quill-drivers; but it has also made them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>a race of exceptionally deep-lunged and
brown-faced quill-drivers.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the case of L&mdash;&mdash;.
L&mdash;&mdash;, nearer twenty than thirty, is a
clerk in a bank here, and he, like our
free-striding heroine, presents a clear and
accurate summary of the tendencies one
notes in the innumerable clerks who
fill the close-packed offices all about him.
He lives “across the water” at New
Brighton, choosing that because of the
half-hour’s river crossing morning and
evening. (He spends that half-hour
walking steadfastly round and round the
upper deck, hat in hand, practising&mdash;if
he can do so unobtrusively&mdash;an elaborate
and, I am sure, highly painful system of
respiration.) He goes to the swimming-bath
twice a week in winter, five or six
times in summer, dodging down there,
if possible, at moments that are perhaps,
from a mere purist’s point of view, not
entirely his own. But in these matters
L&mdash;&mdash; is no mere purist. He does his
work well (he is really a most excellent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>servant), and that suffices. He is paid
£140 a year for doing it well, and that,
too, suffices. It suffices for three
<abbr title="3 pound 3 shilling">£3 3s.</abbr> suits per annum, for subscriptions
to a football club, to a cricket club, to a
tennis club, for a sixth share of the
expenses of running a small yacht, for
a £13 summer holiday, and for his
various trim necessities. He is a close
student of the science of “fitness,” regarding
“fitness” (very properly) as a
thing much superior to any mental
abnormality, and the shilling which
suffices for his daily lunch is not expended
without due dietetical considerations.
Just now it is vegetarianism. Thereafter
he repairs to one of those surprising
underground smoking cabarets&mdash;places
where an Oriental easefulness and languor
loom dimly through a blue narcotic veil&mdash;which
Liverpool, probably because of
her emphatic clericalism, provides in
such extreme abundance, and there, in
the company of other seekers after fitness,
he sips, and smokes, and nibbles one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>the two biscuits with which he is provided
(never both&mdash;that would be a grave <i>faux
pas</i>), and discusses athleticism until a
quarter of an hour after the time he
should be back at his desk. He is lithe,
clean-shaven, temperate, unmarried, and,
in spite of his <i>contes</i>, probably strictly
celibate as well. He reads, but books
are of interest to him chiefly because
they remind him of life, give him a fresh
appetite for the fit and pleasant things
of life; thus, he praises Harland because
his people&mdash;Anthony and the rest&mdash;are
“so immensely decent.” He is not
inordinately religious, but the traditional
piety of his people is a thing he contentedly
accepts. He may one day
migrate (“going abroad” is a familiar
topic in this City of lowly paid clerks and
multitudinous cheap and obvious modes
of exit), and if he does he will certainly
score. If he stays at home he will wind
up with a small bank managership and
as much in the way of golf and week-ends
as £250 a year will permit him to use as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>a salve for the obedient monotony of
small bank management.</p>

<p>That is one type of player. Another,
and much older, is to be found gravely
pacing among those sober buildings in
Brunswick Street. Self-made, but never
blatant; successful because of his common
sense and his genius for hard work,
and remaining common-sensible and
hard-working in spite of his success;
vested with a dignity that sometimes
verges on stolidity; suspicious of sentiment
in life, but an admirer of Bouguereau
in art, he is pre-eminently the
kind of man who ought always to be
commemorated in a steel engraving, never
in a photograph. He has had much to
do with the creation of his City, and
certain of her newer propensities awaken
in him a vague sensation of alarm.
Wealthy, he is a collector rather than an
amateur, but a friend rather than a host.
Not without a rich vein of humour, he
still takes politics quite seriously. His
house (if his family be amenable) has a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>strong mahogany flavour; if his family
be vigorous, that vague feeling of disquietude
pursues him there, where he is
compelled to fit into an incongruous
bungalow-full of <i>art nouveau</i> tenuities.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="caption">
       THE WALKER ART GALLERY&mdash;INTERIOR.
    </p>
</div>

<p>Thus, in spite of the fact that he, more
than any of the others, often startles
one by his resemblance to the tense
Rodinesque figure beyond, he finds himself
already being surrounded by a steady
flow of new modes and influences. E&mdash;&mdash;,
for example, is the vigorous son of one
of these admirable persons; and E&mdash;&mdash;
believes in bungalows, thinks consistent
dignity undignified, and has acquired for
mahogany a distaste which he believes to
be instinctive. I doubt, myself, whether
he has the essential capacity of his parent;
but his practice (he is a solicitor) is
good and whenever one catches his alert,
rather thin, diligently groomed face in
the City, he seems extraordinarily full of
business. He is a member of a club, but
uses it rarely: there is little club life in
Liverpool. His idea of conversation is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>to get one alone, and talk shop with
extreme diligence and (to be just)
much charm. In spite of his <i>art nouveau</i>
proclivities, he has less sincere taste for
the arts than his Bouguereau-appreciating
father; but he has a great stock of
criteria, numbers a local portrait-painter
among his friends, and at the Private
View of the Autumn Exhibition has a
neat, intelligent appraisement for every
notable picture in the room. He never
makes discoveries there, and of course
his range is limited. He has a word of
judicious praise for Hornel (whom his
father still honestly dislikes), but Steer
has not yet emerged from the unimportant
section he vaguely calls Impressionist;
but within those limits his efficiency is
surprising: yes, he is unmistakably intelligent.
He is not quite sure of the
University: actually, unconsciously, he
is just a little afraid of all that it stands
for; and the University, although it
makes a friend of him, has, in private,
an attitude not wholly antithetical to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>pity.... That splitting up&mdash;that
friendly specialization and intelligent
exchange when needed&mdash;of culture, of
business instincts, of dilettantism&mdash;so
different from the inclusive interests,
almost the independent universality, both
of demand and supply, that marked his
father&mdash;I find quite profoundly characteristic
of the Liverpool of the present
moment.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 8.</h3>

<p>Well, there, in their most characteristic
rôles, are some of the chief of the
players who step efficiently, efficiently,
through the six days’ traffic of this well-set
central stage. I have said nothing, it
will be seen, of their nationalities. That
is partly because national characteristics
in Liverpool have a way of bowing to the
local spirit&mdash;or rather, to put it more
accurately, because various national
characteristics have contributed to a
local spirit that an Englishman, a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>Scotchman,
or a Welshman finds it easy and
proper to adopt. Thus, there are any
number of clerks in the North and South
Wales Bank (whose Head Office is here)
who are perfect replicas of L&mdash;&mdash;, and
E&mdash;&mdash; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">père</i>, for all his typical Liverpolitanism,
is really a pure-bred Scot. And
it is partly, too, because any real consideration
of this alluring question of
race would lead to what would be, in this
most cosmopolitan of places, a quite
endless business: the discussion, namely,
of how the pattern of the local spirit has
been affected by the presence of those
charming peoples who draw such bright
exotic threads through the social fabric.</p>

<p>Into all that, unhappily, I have here
no space to enter, nor can I even, much
as I would desire, describe the changes
of cast and play which occasionally take
place: the pale Maeterlinckian drama,
for instance, which is invariably presented
at the close of the six days’
traffic, making a mild hyphen between
Saturday’s curtain and Monday’s <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>overture&mdash;a
coming and going of unknown
people among wide echoes and empty
roadways, with the sleepy Sunday buildings
looking down in a kind of vacant
puzzlement.... Or that other performance,
not in the least Maeterlinckian,
by which the Sunday quiet is succeeded&mdash;the
great Rabelaisian drama of the
Bank Holiday, presented by an entirely
fresh company with new costumes and
new effects. The lumpish dialect of
South Lancashire echoes everywhere
about the stage on such occasions. The
Landing Stage is a prolonged ballet in red
and white and inordinately electric blue.
And although the Cotton Market and the
Stock Exchange are utterly deserted, the
appearance in the streets of a strange,
pinkish, tissue-wropt substance described
(perhaps apocryphally?) as “Liverpool
Rock” would seem to testify to the
discovery, and to the whole-souled encouragement,
of a hitherto unsuspected
local industry.</p>

<p>And I would have liked, too, to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>celebrate
in some measure the change that
sweeps over the City with the oncoming of
night. It is in her native unconsidered
gestures, as I have said, far more than
in her studied poses, that the essential
beauty of Liverpool is most perfectly
revealed; and it is at night, when the
aid of the sunlight is ended and the
sky is a forgotten tale and even the
stars are of as little moment as moths
that palely flutter outside the windows
of a lighted palace, that Liverpool becomes
most elemental and instinctive.
Abandoned by external nature, she becomes
most natural, and therefore attains
her most conspicuous beauty. Those
electric cars, of course, designed purely
for utility, with no thought of spectacle,
give to her nocturnes their special individualizing
note; so that whilst she
has nothing to correspond to that
astonishing golden spray of hansoms
which makes midnight Piccadilly a
place of almost intolerable magnificence,
she has her own rich code, just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>as characteristic, and of but little less
a loveliness. Down London Road, down
Renshaw Street, the crocus-coloured
rivers pour into the vortex of light
that boils beneath the great cliffs of
Saint George’s Hall, so terrible in their
nocturnal shapelessness. Moon-green arc-lamps,
that only Baudelaire could properly
describe, hang, strange fruits, above
the golden turmoil; and it is through
courses fledged by sun-gold and canopied
by this moon-green that the fluent
saffron finally escapes. It sweeps down
Dale Street and Water Street, it sweeps
down Church Street and James Street,
and so pours out, in the end, upon that
streaming terrace by the water-side.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 9.</h3>

<p>So, inevitably, we return in the end
to the River, the beautiful source of all
this beauty, the magnificent architect
of all this golden triumph. I have
spoken already of its daylight loveliness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>of the elemental hungers that it both
feeds and fosters, of its cordial ministry
to all that is most panic in men’s blood.
But with the advent of night it, too,
suffers a deep and splendid change.
Renouncing this medicative disloyalty,
it frankly surrenders itself to the City’s
rule, and becomes a peaceful province of
urbanity. The lights of the City make
golden chains about it, golden lights
from the City patrol its deep recesses. It
is the hour of reconciliations. The City
is more elemental than by day, the River
is less elemental, and a long sustained
harmony unites the flaming tides of the
streets and the darkened causeway of
the tide. Even the boats have shared
the transformation. So eminently business-like
beneath the sun, they are now
changed to shining presences, romantically
visiting the night. Topaz, emerald,
and ruby are their chosen favours, and
widespread robes of cramoisie and gold
reflections trail sumptuously about them
as they move.</p>

<span class="s8 tall">THE SUBURBS</span></h2>

<h3 title="">§ 1.</h3>

<p class="noindent">If one wanted very badly to indulge a
passion for historical retrospect, this
chapter, of course, would provide the
great opportunity. For although it is
customary to regard them as mere upstarts,
the Suburbs of Liverpool, like the
suburbs of so many great towns, are
really much more venerable than the City
itself. West Derby, for instance, was a
place of power and dignity when Liverpool
was a mere huddle of patched
cabins on the marshes away below; and
Bootle, Litherland, Crosby, Walton,
Kirkdale, Smithdown, Wavertree, and
Toxteth, unlike the place that now looks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>down upon them patronizingly, are all
distinguished by references in Doomsday
Book. But in spite of this, and
although, as we shall see, some faint
odour of antiquity still here and there
survives, yet to make anything more
than the barest mention of their fine
old memories and traditions would
be to create a very false impression
of the aspect they present to-day. It
would be quite possible, I imagine, to
wander through Kirkdale for a lifetime
(an inspiring pilgrimage) without once
suspecting that it owed anything to any
other era than excessively mid-Victorian;
and to tell over the far-off things that
made Smithdown and Toxteth names of
terror or magnificence in old days would
be to give about as fair an idea of the
expression now worn by those sober
neighbourhoods as a description of the
old tithe-barn that once stood there
would give of that cautious ante-room in
Tithebarn Street. The Suburbs are certainly
older than the City, but the City
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>has infected them with her youthfulness.
They do, in cold fact, grow younger every
day.</p>

</div>

<p>This double process of suburb-subordination
and suburb-rejuvenescence has
always, of course, been dependent upon
the progress of the arts of locomotion;
and its latest and swiftest phase was
undoubtedly heralded by the clangour
of the gong on the first electric car. It
is her cars, as we have seen, that perfect
Liverpool’s most characteristic beauty.
It is her cars, again, that have helped to
perfect her characteristic homogeneity
and compactness, that have helped to
bind the whole sprawling mass, City and
Suburb and all, more and more tightly
together, both physically and sentimentally,
into one unigenous organism. The
London suburb, save in such districts as
are tapped by the Tube and its companions,
is a fairly self-contained community;
it has its own shops, interests,
concerts, society; and even in many
of our smaller towns and cities the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>general effect is that of a number of
self-interested <em>colonies</em> pouncing upon
the central spaces for the mere means
of life, and then returning to their
own private recesses to dispose of them.
But in Liverpool the Suburbs tend more
and more to part with their independence,
to “pool” their interests and
enjoyments, to form themselves into a
kind of family party ranged round the
brightly burning grate of the City. And
they grow more like a family party, not
only because of this absorption in a common
atmosphere, but also because of the
increasing freedom which marks their
intercourse one with another. That
division of the residential semicircle into
specific social <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faubourgs</i>&mdash;Scotch engineers
in Bootle, for instance, Welsh
builders in Everton, merchants in Sefton
Park&mdash;which subsisted very definitely
until quite recently, is now in large
measure being broken down. Interfusion
of social states goes on with
constantly increasing rapidity. Families
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>who now migrate with the utmost nonchalance
from, say, Kirkdale to Aigburth,
confident of finding somewhere there precisely
the strata to which they have been
accustomed, would have looked on such a
flight only last generation as being almost
as impossible, almost as profoundly
charged with social significations, as a
transfer from Poplar to Park Lane; and
were content, as I well know, to live and
die and inherit without stirring, without
dreaming of forsaking an equally static
coterie of friends. Well, the chief agent
in breaking down these social divisions
was also that art of locomotion to the
encouragement of which Liverpool, as I
have said, has so peculiarly devoted herself,
and the latest, the most democratic,
and the most mobile of the creations of
that art, the electric car, has inevitably
increased that fluidity in a very remarkable
degree.<a name="Anchor_4" id="Anchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4.">[4]</a> The overhead wires that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
bring every suburb into vital connexion
with the centre are like the radiating
nerves of the organism, flushing all the
extremities with one sympathetic life.</p>

    <dd>It is impossible to doubt that Liverpool’s
conspicuous devotion to the business of locomotion&mdash;a
devotion that is briefly evidenced
by the significant association of her name with
the first railway, the first canal, one of the
first sub-river underground railways, the first
electric overhead railway, the first sustained
application of electricity to long-distance railway
traction, and now with these electric road
cars&mdash;owed its first impulse to that comparative
isolation of her early situation to which I
referred in the first Chapter, and that the eager
continuance of that devotion was largely due
to the function of universal carrier which was
afterwards imposed upon her. It is equally
impossible to doubt that it was that early
isolation which helped, at the outset, to foster
her spirit of independent and concerted effort.
And it is, therefore (to me, at any rate), rather
a pleasant reflection, and not perhaps a wholly
useless one, that the circumstance which
primarily and directly induced that essential
solidarity was also the circumstance which
created the tools for riveting it; and that the
creation of those tools was considerably aided
by the apparition of precisely those forces
which seemed to threaten her with a disrupting
cosmopolitanism.</dd>

<p>It is by the presence of these wires,
then, that you may recognize the great
suburb-reaching thoroughfares, the raying
bones of our all but unfurled fan, and by
taking up a position at one of the central
junctions&mdash;that river-side terrace would
be an excellent place&mdash;you may traverse
them all in turn, and examine almost
all the details of the residential plume,
with no more trouble than is caused by
stepping from pavement to car-platform,
from car-platform back again to pavement.
Seaforth tips the first bone;
Litherland the second; Walton, Aintree
and Fazakerley, Everton and Anfield,
Cabbage Hall, Tuebrook and West
Derby, variously feather the third, fourth,
fifth, and sixth; whilst Fairfield, Old
Swan and Knotty Ash, Edge Hill and
Wavertree, Sefton Park and Mossley
Hill, Dingle, Aigburth and Garston,
fledge the remaining branches in the
east and south.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
<p>Great Howard Street, Derby Road,
and Rimrose Road, the three nominal
sections of the first of these plangent
ways, are tipped, as I say, by Seaforth,
and to reach Seaforth they have to bore
their way through the dense landscape
of warehouses and timber-yards that
lies behind the northern docks. But
out beyond Seaforth, through Waterloo,
Blundellsands, Altcar (its rifle-ranges
crackling like a coffee-mill), Formby,
Freshfield, and Birkdale, that other humming
river of electricity, the most western
arm of the Lancashire and Yorkshire
Railway, whose course the road from the
first pretty closely follows, drains (or,
rather, feeds) a constantly spreading,
bungalow-saturated district of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne bourgeoisie</i>.
It is all very prosperous, this
new rubicund neighbourhood: sand-hills
and wide shore spread between it and
the sea; half a dozen golf-links accompany
its brisk march by the railway-side;
and that march can really scarcely
be regarded as completed until the railway
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>terminates, and plutocracy flames up in
a last supreme outburst, twenty miles
away from Liverpool, among the bathing-vans
and pierrots of Southport: for
Southport, too, in spite of plutocratic
hauteur, is being rapidly induced by
locomotion to play the part of Liverpool’s
accessory. And Southport presents, anyhow,
a series of little paradoxes in appearance
upon which one could desire to
linger. It is, for instance, at once the
chosen home of countless millionaires,
and the chosen resort of countless cheap
day-trippers. (Although that, indeed, if
all local tales be true, is less fundamental
a paradox than might perhaps
be supposed.) Antitheses&mdash;at any rate
superficial antitheses&mdash;are in consequence
engagingly plentiful, and at night the
place crowns this distracting effect by
assuming all the airs and graces of the
Continent. Lights thickly sown among
the prolonged verdure of its central
boulevard, a red-coated band and endless
promenaders, little tables beneath the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>trees&mdash;yes, it is all, to the eye, very
perfectly arranged.... And then,
suddenly, disastrously, there emerges the
slow accent, the toilsome facetiousness,
of Chowbent.... But it is still very
charming to have so many of the
materials of illusion so ingeniously provided;
and one looks back at evenings
spent there, discreetly companioned, with
a very quick tinge of pleasure.</p>

<p>As for Seaforth itself, the first link in
this chain of seaside settlements&mdash;well,
it, naturally, is the least personable of
them all. “The slums of the future,”
say the pessimists sententiously; and
already a notable greyness begins to
creep over its tightly packed workmen’s
cottages. It seems especially deplorable,
for the shore of the place (unbelievably
peppered in the summer heats with
naked pinkish youngsters) is clean and
fair enough, New Brighton glitters pleasantly
across the estuary, the Welsh hills
heave up in the distance, and the great
ships of the world promenade before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>its parlour windows. A little further
along the coast, towards Waterloo, the
Marconi station leans upon its tall central
mast like a sentry on his spear, and
listens to the cries of other great ships
fighting in the clutch of some blind
Atlantic storm.</p>

<p>Not far away, and even more conspicuous,
a high, livid convent, many-windowed
and forbidding, rises up out
of the sand; and on its flat roof, remote
against the sky, you may sometimes see
the good nuns pacing to and fro together,
or leaning solitarily against the wind.
They must survey a bold and various
prospect. On the one hand the level floor
of the sea, here dusked, there silvered,
marbled by voyaging clouds, runs out
until it meets a wide pure sky. Poised
at the western extreme of the long
horizon blade, Anglesey rests like a
sapphire, and the hem of all the air that
sweeps away to the south is braided
thereafter by the woven hills of Wales.
From them the eye stoops successively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>to the shimmering aura of the Dee, to
the embossed interspace of the Wirral,
to the bright-mailed river down below,
and so to the louring masses of the City,
ranging darkly out towards the east, a
creation more terribly unhuman than
even the mountains or the sea. Lastly,
there is the scaly back of the suburb
lying beneath, and, beyond it, unfolding
between that spreading blackness in the
south and a rim of purple woodland in
the north, a fair carpet of meadowland
and cornfield runs clear and away. A
rare white farm or so, set in that green
tranquillity, invest it with a kind of
homely joy. And the tender outlines of
a sister convent near at hand, rising
gravely among the serene devices of its
trees, touch that joy with a patience
as of evening.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 3.</h3>

<p>But although it thus provides a very
gracious incident in the landscape, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>sister convent, the Convent of Our Good
Shepherd down at Ford, plays no small
part in increasing the dolour of the
second of our great northward-driving
roadways. For its annexe, hidden among
those trees, is one of the chief of Liverpool’s
Catholic cemeteries, and since this
second “bone” (Scotland Road, Stanley
Road, Linacre Road, are its successive
names) passes through the very heart of
the Irish quarter of Liverpool, it follows
that a grim pageant of rococo hearses,
plumes, and jaded mourners passes constantly
along this thoroughfare every
Sunday in the year. It certainly stands
in no need of these aids to sobriety.
Quite on its own merits it succeeds in
being the most profoundly depressing
highway in all Liverpool. It plunges,
the moment it leaves the City, into the
tawdry litter of shops that edge the
northern slum, and it is defamed, all
thereabout, by the sour sights and sounds
and smells (the sights and sounds and
smells which we are to investigate in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>the next chapter) which the northern
slum exudes. It runs, after that, along
the ragged fringe of the grey curtain of
shoddy streets that droops drearily down
from the stooping shoulder of Everton.
And it winds up, at Linacre, with an
altogether abominable jangle of raw
street-ends, waste lands, gasometers, and
factories. Its solitary moment of even
comparative cheerfulness, indeed, is to
be set down to the credit of Bootle. At
Bootle you catch a glimpse of a couple of
parks; a broad avenue&mdash;trim, well-treed,
and topped by an elegant spire&mdash;sweeps
proudly across your track; and signs of
free-stone and prosperity are not wanting.
Lacking that respite, this arrow-straight
four-mile stretch from the Old Haymarket
to the terminus at Linacre Road
would infallibly induce neurasthenia.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="image_old_haymarket" id="image_old_haymarket"><img src="images/old_haymarket.jpg" alt="Old Haymarket" title="Old Haymarket" /></a>
    <p class="caption">
       OLD HAYMARKET
    </p>
</div>

<p>Not that Bootle ever receives the
slightest acknowledgment for this fine
alleviating effort. It is a curious thing,
but no Liverpolitan to whom you may
ever speak will permit himself to refer to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>Bootle except in tones of an amused contempt.
In part, no doubt, this is a result
of Bootle’s obstinate, exotic retention of
her independence. In spite of the identity
of interests, in spite of the physical
absorption which long ago took place,
Bootle still clings vehemently to her
separate Boroughship; and not all the
engines of suasion or attack (and both
sorts have been energetically applied)
that Liverpool can level against her seem
able to encompass the surrender. Vividly
exceptional, breaking up, at any rate
theoretically, the co-ordination that
would else be almost universal, she still
adheres to all the formulæ of a separate
social and municipal existence: appointing
her own Mayor, lodging him in an
impressive Town Hall, making him the
hub of a brightly revolving wheel of
emphatically local sociabilities. And
Liverpool, incensed, no doubt, by this
gross transgression of the physical and
sentimental laws that rule her life, responds
with a dole of contempt.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>
<p>It is terribly unfair, of course; for
Bootle, in spite of the fact that its dockside
quarters are not places of an overwhelming
lucency and charm, really does
possess many gentle and engaging attributes,
not least among them being the
spasmodic presence in its midst (even yet
in larger numbers than elsewhere) of
the most delightful broad Scotch seagoing
engineers&mdash;sitters (when in port)
in stifling back sitting-rooms&mdash;smokers
of incomparable cigars (on which duty
may or may not have been paid)&mdash;possessors
of a very precise knowledge of
the healing virtues of strong waters....
And yet, in spite of the unfairness of
that contempt, one can’t help feeling
that perhaps, after all&mdash;independence or
no independence&mdash;something of the sort
was inevitable. Frankly, what is to
be expected by a place so unhappily
named? Its absurdity is crushing.
Bootle, tootle, footle&mdash;and not another
rhyme-sound in the language. <em>Buckingham
Palace, Bootle</em>; <em>White Nights, Bootle</em>:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>clearly, note-paper could affect no address,
from the most stately to the most
charming, that it would not instantly
convert to screaming farce. And to
protest that the name is of the most
honourable antiquity is by no means to
avoid the consequences. It simply invests
the whole business with an extra tinge of
tragedy.</p>

<p>Independence of another sort, as yet
untouched by tragedy, and awakening in
the soul of the Liverpolitan something
more like envy than contempt, is to be
found at Litherland, which lies just
beyond that raucous Linacre terminus, a
few steps nearer to the cemetery at Ford.
They are steps that provide an effective
study in contrasts. They carry one
across a frail little swing-bridge; and
whilst one end of the bridge is immersed
in that bad-tempered outburst of industrialism,
the other shares an atmosphere
of positively Quakerish demureness. Mild
old Georgian residences, placidly sunning
themselves among their groves and lawns,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>are respectfully waited upon by an irresistible
village street of shops and inns
and a post office. In the mildest and
sunniest residence of all the Urban District
Council has comfortably established
itself; the village fire-escape sits contentedly
upon the lawn; and the orchard
at the rear has been contrived into an
alley echoing with bird-song, where councillors
and counselled may foregather
with their evening pipes.... It is that
highly prosaic thing, the Leeds and Liverpool
Canal, that has apparently served to
keep this idyll unspotted by the world.
It curves like a defensive moat between
the bird-song and the harsh imbroglio a
biscuit’s-throw beyond, and upon the
frail structure that crosses it not the
most reckless electric car in the world
would ever dream of venturing. It is
the weakness of that bridge that has
proved the place’s strength.</p>

<p>It was in the very shadow of that
enviable fire-escape, by the way, that I
heard of another and a subtler way in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>which the electric car carries on its business
of subversion. My informant was
an Urban District retainer, whom I
found, the other afternoon, bedding out
the Urban District geraniums. I spoke
to him regarding the pleasantness of
the neighbourhood, praised its quiet, its
salubrity, and so forth. He merely subscribed
a perfunctory assent. Judging
that my pæan was considered to lack the
appropriate degree of fervour, I redoubled
my efforts. I waxed really
eloquent. Superlatives abounded. But
my strophe aroused no antistrophe. The
more loudly did I extol, indeed, the
gloomier and more perfunctory became
his replies. At last I touched on
rates, and that proved the last straw.
“They’re only two shillings and ninepence,”
he burst out wrathfully&mdash;I
think it was two shillings and ninepence;
anyhow, something quite preposterously
minute&mdash;“and over in Liverpool folks
is paying eight or nine shillin’.” It certainly
seemed an extraordinary sort of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>grievance.... And then “They use
our cars,” he went on savagely&mdash;“they
use our cars an’ libries an’ baths. Why
shouldn’t they help to pay for ’em?...
But they can’t ’old out for ever; Liverpool
will nab the place some o’ these fine
days.” And he glanced at the genteel
old stucco with an air of malevolent
triumph.</p>

<p>The man, it will be seen, was himself a
Liverpolitan, and I dare say he voiced
very fairly the general Liverpolitan sentiment
in these matters. “You use our
cars; clearly, then, you must be one of
us; so quit this foolish pose of independence.”
And one day, no doubt, it will
quit the pose perforce. Liverpool will
“nab” it, the moat will be stoutly
bridged, a troop of electric cars will
storm across, and the quiet little gathering
among the trees will be rudely broken
up and submerged.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 4.</h3>

<p>To witness the actual consummation of
such a ravagement, it is only necessary
to follow the next “bone” as far as
Walton-on-the-Hill. Walton, to my
mind, stands as a perfect embodiment of
all the mingled tragedy and triumph of
this great process of suburb overthrow.
For centuries her Church was the proud
hub of the parish in which Liverpool was
but an inconsiderable hamlet; and even
so late as the last year of the seventeenth
century she compelled Liverpool to regard
her as its parochial superior, and to
tramp every Sunday three miles out to
her and three miles back. There is little
pride left to the old Church now. It
stands, bleak and friendless, in the midst
of a dull pool of gravestones; smoke from
a railway siding blackens its walls; the
cars roar triumphantly past its very
gates; it has been compelled to guard
its dead with rows of iron railings. In
the lanes that cower behind it, too,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>defeat is equally apparent: scraps of
villagedom hunted down by a rabble of
red-faced tenements; a mass of garish
brick squatting blatantly in the ruins of
a cornfield; jerry-builders evicting old
residents from the cottages they have
lived in for half a century; the old Hall,
in its nest of trees, lying fouled and rifled.
In the shadow of the Church there is a
little cottage that has the reputation,
significantly enough, of being the only
thatched cottage in Liverpool. It is
delicately complexioned, daintily windowed,
and altogether very fragrant and
delightful. But the poor soul, one
fancies, is not long for this world. A
frenzied hoarding, horrent and gibbering,
raves above it on one side; on the other
some kind of corrugated iron affair
screws its blunt shoulder into the frail
old bones.... One seems to catch a
gleam of piteous supplication behind the
leaded panes.</p>

<p>But just beside the Church one gets
the modern touch that seems to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>amends. It is from here that the great
new road&mdash;wide, much-foliaged, grass-platted&mdash;begins
the journey which is to
result in a curving band of ordered
white and green being drawn right
through the mass of eastern suburbs: a
noble avenue which posterity will pace
delightedly, thinking kind thoughts of
1907. It is an admirable project, and a
fine salve for outraged sentiment. It
sets the seal on Walton’s defeat: more
even than the red-faced streets does it
signalize her absorption in the mass;
but it is none the less a thing one welcomes
with enthusiasm. Thatch, after
all, is not the final excellence of life.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 5.</h3>

<p>And, in any case, if Walton still
thirsts for redress, she can surely regard
herself as amply revenged by her sister
suburb, Aintree. For Aintree, to no
inconsiderable proportion of the inhabitants
of the British Isles, is a vastly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>more important place than Liverpool&mdash;Liverpool,
indeed, for them, deriving its
sole significance from the fact that it is
a well-trained and useful attendant at
Aintree’s door. The secret, of course, is
the Grand National&mdash;most searching of
all the national rhapsodies we strum
on horse-flesh&mdash;which is performed here
every spring.</p>

<p>Big race-meetings don’t vary very
much; and Grand National Day at
Aintree presents much the same features
as one finds elsewhere. There are the
same great stands, looking, from a
proletarian distance, like boxes crammed
with flowers; the same sliding bourdon
from the betting-rings; the same sudden
drift of music that means that Majesty
has arrived, that Majesty is mounting
the Stand, that Majesty’s binoculars are
even now compressing the whole astonishing
landscape into one bright little picture
for Majesty’s eyes. Follows, as
always, the remote, wavering crescent
at the starting-point; the delicate stream
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>of coloured scraps, blowing as before a
wind, rising and falling here and there
in easy, soundless undulations; the faint,
raw crash of sound as the stream flutters
beneath the quivering sparkle of the
Stands. And afterwards, the usual black
flood of people pouring across the plain,
the usual sententious groups about the
jumps, the usual rancid litter, the inevitable
dizzy smell of trodden turf.</p>

<p>Only, right at the end, there is one
amendment to note. The traditional
hotchpotch of home-returning vehicles
has been replaced by something else.
Away in the centre of the City some one
in a little office signs an order; and
when the mob pours out, it discovers
long glittering files of electric cars awaiting
it at the entrance. So, independently
propelled no longer, but packed sociably
together, they sweep back to the heart
of the City, past the sad walls of Walton
Church, a magnificent official cavalcade.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 6.</h3>

<p>Walton’s drab neighbours on the other
side, too, have also their sporting associations,
and, in consequence, some
measure of independent fame. Each
Saturday afternoon throughout the
winter grey clouds of sound drift over
all this northern district and out into
the country beyond: rivalling for a time
the brazen rumours from the River which
are always visiting these airs. They
rise from the great football-grounds at
Everton and Anfield, where some tens
of thousands of enthusiasts, incredibly
packed together (any number of the
worst-paid of L&mdash;&mdash;’s understudies
among them), indulge, week after week,
a passion for vicarious athletics.</p>

<p>There is always something rather
heartsome about the sound of distant
cheering, and in this case one welcomes
these tumults with an especial enthusiasm.
It would probably be unjust to suggest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>that they stand for the most positive
moment in the lives of the cheerers, but
it is certainly true that they provide the
most positive note in the whole of the
dull regions that surround them. Towards
Stanley Park, indeed, in Anfield,
there is a momentary touch of something
that is almost sprightliness; and over
in Everton, near the hill from which
De Quincey admired the view of distant
Liverpool, there is a flavour of dignified
decay. But, for the rest, there are only
labyrinthine miles of gardenless, spiritless
streets, neither new nor old, neither
vicious nor respectable&mdash;always tragically
null and inchoate. They involve Kirkdale;
they trail out towards Cabbage
Hall; they trudge past Newsham Park,
and so away towards the south. The main
ribs strike across them here and there,
distributing a little colour&mdash;paper-shops,
tobacconists’, sweet-shops, the rich phials
of a drug-store, butchers’ slabs covered
with intricate runes of red and yellow;
but these respites are desperately <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>restricted.
The gleam dies away as quickly
as the sound of the car-gongs; the web
slinks back into its old monotony, into
that grey neutrality which seems, somehow,
to be far baser and more vitiating
than the brute positive blackness of the
slums.</p>

<p>To explain these regions, to see them
(as we ought to see them) as something
more than a dull and featureless enigma,
it is needful to regard them in relation to
the City, to see them as one of the
essential whorls in the great hieroglyph
which is Liverpool. Looked at in this
way, they do begin to reveal a kind of
meaning, even to assume a kind of magnificence.
They mean that Liverpool
demands, for the prosecution of her so
colourful adventures, the services of so
many thousands of grey lives, the efforts
of a great brotherhood content to labour
all day long on her behalf in exchange
for permission to return at nightfall just
here, to make themselves a home in
just this stretch of barren twilight. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>cannot let them go further afield; she
cannot grant them space enough for
brightness. This much she can afford
them, and no more.</p>

<p>So regarded, all this drabness becomes
something much more terrible and magnificent
than a mere neutral foil to the
City’s beauty, a mere grey passage which
throws the purple into relief. It becomes
one of the sources of that beauty,
one of the processes by which that beauty
was attained&mdash;a grey and dreadful ritual
observed by the City in the hope of being
granted strange powers. These dull
houses are so much squeezed dye-wood.
Their colour, their brightness, have gone
to stain the rich fabric of the City’s
enterprise, to paint the romantic emblem
by which she is known in dim corners of
the earth, to illuminate the saga of her
career. And, remembering this, it becomes
almost possible to regard the
dwellers in these regions less as prisoners
in a dull and sorrowful gaol than as
priests in the recesses of some twilit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>temple, gravely and honourably fulfilling
sacred offices.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 7.</h3>

<p>At the same time, it is, no doubt, only
too easy to overestimate the heaviness
of the twilight. Here is human nature
packed thick and thick, and where there
is human nature, there romance is also.
Theoretically, therefore, the whole place
is seething with adventure, and each
one of these drab doorways is an entrance
to a palpitating epic. Theoretically, all
this monotony is but a mask, and beneath
it there are warm human features,
quick and variable with terror and pity
and passion and quiet joy. It may be
so; but those doors remain implacably
closed, the mask is never dropped; all
this great romance is writ in cipher.
Here and there a phrase emerges: a
couple of youths whispering at a corner;
a woman wrapped in a shawl singing
drearily in an empty street; an old man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>solemnly tapping at a door; a child
running screaming from a curtainless
house; and one fingers them for a little,
and pores over them, but in the end is
always forced to push them despairingly
aside. The key is lacking; they remain
enigmatic; and one might wander these
grey sad streets for ever and learn
nothing of their secrets. Every house
is inarticulate; a menacing dumbness
broods over the whole region.</p>

<p>And it is by personal associations alone
that those secrets can be surprised.
Directories carry us a little way: they tell
us that two cabmen, a draper’s assistant,
a cotton-porter, a stoker, a bricklayer,
and a carter, live in that half-dozen liver-coloured
brick boxes; and the knowledge
certainly invests the place (it is a street
in Anfield) with a tinge of actuality. But
there are so many other things we require
to know about that bricklayer&mdash;the
colour of his wife’s eyes, for instance;
whether he prefers hot-pot or Irish-stew;
whether his youngest has yet had the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>measles. At Sefton Park, at Blundellsands,
qualities analogous to these are
easily discoverable, even by the outsider;
but here they are hidden away beneath
an unfathomable monotony. To discover
the romance, to taste the secret
drama that makes Anfield and Everton
and Cabbage Hall habitable, it would be
necessary to live in each of them in turn,
to have an initiating friend in every
road.... Thus, in a little street behind
Netherfield Road there live a couple of
dear old maiden ladies, whom the progress
of education has prevented from
teaching and taught to starve, and
whose training has made them determined
to starve respectably, in private;
and knowledge of them and of their
drama has made, for me, that street a
shade less cryptic. And then, again,
over in Edge Hill there is a little bed-sitting-room
overlooking a stale back-yard
where I used to go once a week to
hear the Kosmos put in order by a poet
who wrote bad verses, but quoted good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
ones. To the outsider Edge Hill must
seem as inscrutably monotonous as its
neighbours. But I know better. It revealed
itself to me, in those days, as a
wonderful avenue to all manner of tender
and high-hearted possibilities; and I still
recall evenings spent in the Botanic
Gardens over there, with my poet mouthing
some splendid scarlet thing from
Whitman or Shelley in the afterglow,
when the place seemed positively surcharged
with vital and dramatic loveliness.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 8.</h3>

<p>But revealing experiences of this sort are
inevitably limited, and, lacking any great
store of them, one is content to fall
back on broad summaries, to say that
this crepuscular region stretches from
Anfield and Everton in the north, below
Newsham Park, through Edge Hill, and
so towards Wavertree in the south. It
has its degrees of neutrality, of course&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>amenities
creep occasionally in&mdash;but for
the most part it remains a region
whose intimate meanings are concealed
by its monotony, but whose monotony
gives it in the mass a deep and terrible
significance.</p>

<p>And below this tract, gravely introducing
its later passages to the City,
there marches a dull, highly respectable
quarter of streets and squares (rare
episodes, these latter, in Liverpool), of
which, again, one can only protest that
it is really much more impressive than
it seems. There is Abercromby Square,
where the Bishop lives; there is Oxford
Street, upon which the shade of Aubrey
Beardsley is reported to make an occasional
shrinking descent; there are
Catherine Street, Bedford Street, Chatham
Street, all earnestly pleading for
geranium boxes; and Rodney Street,
where many doctors and one small
green slab combine to surround Gladstone’s
birthplace with an appropriate
atmosphere of dignity. And so at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
length to the verge of the hill that cups
the City, with the Philharmonic Hall
making one part of it a place, on winter
nights, of ringing hoofs and thronging
audiences, and the University, in another,
looking gravely down upon the
rooftops of the tense and vivid City
which it is its duty by scholarship to
serve.</p>

<p>And on the other side of that dumb
territory there always sweep the suburbs
that have the green fields for their
neighbours: the suburbs that here delicately
woo the country and there vulgarly
accost it, and now stop short at the sight
of it with a gorgeous affectation of
surprise, and now stealthily seduce it
into all manner of morbid episodes;
but whose essential business is always,
by this device or by that, to lure the
fields into the state of urbanity, to
establish fresh colonies and receptacles
for the constantly swelling mass that
seethes behind. Cabbage Hall, the
northernmost, plays the part of stealthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
seducer, dribbling out among the fields
in colourless disorder, entrapping them
in the dreariest fashion, without a hint
of glamour. Next comes West Derby, a
group of clean-faced cottages standing
about its car-terminus like smocked
village children gaping prettily at a lurid
visitor, its neatly dignified church and
deer-scattered park reflecting the outburst
of ripe, authentic aristocracy that
makes the country-side beyond so unexpectedly,
so exotically, old English.
And after West Derby come Knotty Ash
and Old Swan: the first, in one’s pocket
vision of it, a jolly stage-setting of taverns
with farm-carts before them, of tiny,
twinkling pinafores pouring out of a
village school, of a neat spire (a property
it doesn’t, however, do to investigate
too closely) rising above a grove of realistic
trees; the second&mdash;suffering in
places from a bad attack of the scarlet-fever
which is now ravaging domestic
architecture&mdash;leading to a long surge of
ambiguous ways and broken ends that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>spills out finally among the fields near
Wavertree. The country on which it
breaks has qualities of richness; little
coils of woodland lie pleasantly among
leaning meadows; and right in the midst
of it, like a fleck of pure foam far cast
by the muddy wave of the town, lie the
lawns and gardens of Calderstone, the
latest of Liverpool’s parks.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 9.</h3>

<p>For parkland proper, however, it is
needful to return to the smoke. Wavertree
lies at the end of the Smithdown
Road bone of the fan. The next bone
pierces that Bloomsbury-like district of
highly respectable squares, and so comes
out upon the tail of a long regiment of
trees making a fine effort to live up to
their reputation of being a boulevard.
This is Princes Avenue, and Princes
Avenue (familiarity breeding uncontempt)
is sometimes spoken of in the
same breath as Berlin’s Unter den Linden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
But although the conjunction is
scarcely wise, this broad way of trees
and churches makes a wholly pleasant
approach to the suavest of Liverpool’s
inner suburbs; and it leads, too, to a
deftly-handled space of open air, where
it is certainly possible to think of the
Champs Elysées without a blush. Sefton
Park, although it may not serve so deeply
human a purpose as, say, Stanley Park
in the north, is certainly quite the most
perfectly fashioned of Liverpool’s open
spaces; and although it is the largest, it
never commits the mistake that large
parks sometimes make of endeavouring
to appear like a piece of virginal country.
It is always mannered, self-conscious,
full of effects that are in the right sense
“picturesque”; and the sheep that feed
in one part of it do not seem much less
deliberately decorative in intention than
the peacocks that everywhere admirably
strut and flower. To find one of these
peacocks (the white one preferably) self-consciously
posing on a meadow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
rhythmical daffodils is to discover the
true spirit of park artistry symbolized
with absolute perfection.</p>

<p>Eminently Parisian in the morning,
when the nurse-girls bring their charges
here, and gossip and read and scold and
perfunctorily play ball precisely as the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonnes</i> do in the Champs Elysées, Sefton
Park grows unmistakably British in the
sacred hour that lapses between tea and
dinner. For then young athletes like
L&mdash;&mdash;, and Hebes like our heroine, fill
all its tennis-courts with a white-limbed
energy.... It is not exactly a white-limbed
energy that one observes in the
adjoining bowling-green; and its laborious,
stooping, shirt-sleeved figures may
conceivably be regarded as striking
rather a dissonant note amongst the
clean-cut decorative activities which
surround it. But none the less the
sociologist in one eagerly welcomes and
commemorates them. For their apparition
is another evidence of that coalescence
of strata with strata which is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
of the features of suburb life just now.
They mean that laborious, stooping,
shirt-sleeved figures can live nowadays
in the once exclusive neighbourhood
hereabout; can demand, for their own
especial pleasures, some share of the
glittering accessory with which this suave
neighbourhood once rather royally provided
itself.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 10.</h3>

<p>But the neighbourhood that immediately
environs the Park still remains
fairly costly and responsible, and that
it seems a little to fall short of absolute
impressiveness is doubtless largely due
to the overwhelming nature of its accessory.
And then, too, it should be remembered,
these yellow, uneasy houses came
before the bungalow had taught a reasonable
compromise between dignity and
domesticity. A little further away, up
towards Mossley Hill, the success is
notably greater. Grave roads, filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
that indescribable hushed exclusiveness
which only tall, ripe, sandstone walls
and overarching leafage have power to
confer, lead up the hill towards the
Church. There are deliberate lodges and
sudden glimpses of deep-breathing lawn;
life grows leisurely and communicative;
the silence is full of confessions.</p>

<p>The Church itself, bulking monumentally
against the sky, continues the warm,
grave intimacy: even the green stillness
that encircles it seems fuller of humanity
than all the acres, dense with flesh and
blood, over at Everton and Anfield. It
is always worth while, therefore, to step
through to the farther wall. There, in
a flash, you find you have come again
to the uttermost edge of the town. A
great landscape leaps suddenly out from
beneath your feet, woods curve distantly
about it, sweet airs bring a company
of quiet sounds. A chalk line
being softly ruled across the green map
means that half a hundred people who
have just had tea in town will see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
buses in the Euston Road before dinner.
A vague smear on the far sky stands
for Widnes and poison. A fainter smear
above the tree-tops to the right reveals
the neighbourhood of Garston.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 11.</h3>

<p>And with Garston we reach the tip
of the last of the plumes of our fan.
Viewed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de profil</i>&mdash;as, for instance, from
the River&mdash;it would appear to be furnished
chiefly with gasometers. The
concomitants of gasometers are as invariable
as those of race-meetings: Garston
is grimy. Considered more closely,
however, it breaks up a little, and reveals
here and there some wholly pleasant
incidents. And on its inland side it
yields very gracefully to the influence
of the shadowed lanes from Allerton.</p>

<p>The rib that joins it to the centre,
sweeps, in the first place, through an
easy, spacious district of private parks
and well-preserved, middle-aged mansions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
and, in the last place, through the
débris of the southern slums. Its name
in this last phase is Park Lane. If, perceiving
that, the visitor feel impelled to
smile as at an anticlimax, he would
perhaps do well to hesitate; for this
Park Lane has probably a wider reputation
than any other thoroughfare in
Europe. In and about this débris stand
the sailors’ quarters, the foreign quarters,
the Chinese Colony, the emigrants’
lodging-houses, the Sailors’ Home; and
the street that threads these things
(“Parkee Lanee Street” the coolies call
it) is spoken of affectionately in every
corner of the Seven Seas. Park Lane
probably spells home to half the sailors
in the world.</p>

<p>Midway in its course this last rib
separates the decaying gentility south
of Princes Park from the frankly homespun
suburb of the Dingle. But even
the Dingle, since it marches cheek by
jowl with the River, cannot escape being
occasionally infected with romance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
There is one little row of apparently
quite subdued little tenements, for instance,
whose lives must really be one
long debauch of raw sensation. I do
not insist upon the haunting presence
of the Fever Hospital at one end of them;
nor upon that of the lean bridge which
stalks appallingly across a ramping railway-siding
at the other; for these are
incidents of a sort that make other neighbourhoods
tremendous. But these cottages
have perched themselves exactly
on the brink of the ragged cliff which
surrounds that ultimate dock, the Herculaneum,
and beneath them a group
of black monsters are always at work
plucking trucks of coal bodily from the
railway and plunging them into the
bowels of chained ships. Further over,
there are the peering heads and shoulders
of embedded liners; further, again, the
wide manuscript of the River, lurid
with adventure; and, beyond that, the
stony slopes of the Wirral. Nor is this
all; for immediately below their doorsteps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
some thousands of gallons of petroleum
are stored in the live rock, and
somewhere beneath their kitchen floors
the Midland expresses race and hammer
all day long.</p>

<p>Certainly, if it is roaring melodrama
one thirsts for, the Dingle, in spite of
its drabness, is clearly the place to
dwell.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 12.</h3>

<p>I have just spoken of the stony slopes
of the Wirral. The stones, of course, are
houses, and the houses form themselves
into suburbs, and those suburbs troop
all about the coast, and pour inland, and
tend to fill all the green peninsula with
pleasant cubicles. But of those suburbs
and all the tranquil spaces they lead to
and enclose I must not now attempt to
speak. Their qualities are many: river
and sea, heather, champaign, woven
coppice, and swart fir-wood grant them
a procession of aspects no mere generalization
could include. Port Sunlight set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
out as though for an old English festival;
Eastham with its woods and booths;
New Ferry and Rock Ferry, the stony
slopes that lead at length to Birkenhead;
Birkenhead itself, a march played like
a dirge; Seacombe, Egremont, New
Brighton, promenade-linked, wide-shored,
flickering out into all manner of watering-place
delights; Leasowe, whose sea-beaten
coppices are wonderful in spring
with ranks of praying white and hymning
purple; Hoylake, with its famous links
and golfing fishermen; Thurstaston,
with its legendary hills and dear
memories; Heswall, sunset-saturated
among its heaths; Prenton, with its
pine-woods and its water-tower; Oxton,
mellow and meticulous upon its height:
so do I content myself with naming
them, and, so naming them, add one
word of admiration for the dainty fashion
in which, in her green chamber, Wirral
makes the beds for so many of the
workers in the streets across the way.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

    </p>
</div>

<p>But there is one place in the Wirral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>about which I must inevitably add
another word. Both practically and
sentimentally, indeed, Bidston Hill belongs
to Liverpool: practically because
it is the property of the Mersey Docks
and Harbour Board, and because its
Pharos plays so large a part in directing
the courses of the fleets; sentimentally&mdash;well,
sentimentally for a dozen excellent
good reasons. It would be from here,
no doubt, in the old days, that the
traveller from the south would catch
his first glimpse of the River and the
hamlet; it is from here that generation
after generation of townsfolk have come
to see their City in its bulk; it is here
still that they bring the good stranger,
hoping secretly that he will find their
Liverpool a rather wonderful and alluring
sort of place. And certainly it is
from here, among this almond-scented
gorse, that Liverpool builds up most
perfectly into a visible entity. The
City and its outposts draw easily together;
the Dock Board Building makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
an ivory nucleus; and Walton Church
on the left, and Mossley Hill Church on
the right, seem, in actuality, as they are
in essence, but two organic incidents in
the great design of which it forms the
centre. The bird-song and the dumbness,
the green spaces and the grey, the
hid tragedies, the fair buildings, the
lavish, roaring ways, are now merged
wonderfully together, and, in their fusion,
form one supreme attribute, nameless
because it is unhuman. Smoke-scarves
of her own weaving and vapours of
the air binding her and her children
together, Liverpool broods there in the
sunshine, sole and indivisible, a splendid
seaward-facing Presence. And the River
flames at her feet.</p>

<p class="noindent">She couches there like a vast Presence,
seaward-facing but inly brooding, and,
indeed, it is profoundly true that the
remote adventures she surveys draw
much of their range and splendour from
the darkness of her private dreams. For
in a manner much more direct and unescapable
than those dumb grey regions
in the east, these black abysses of her
underworld are intimately bound up with
the chief sources of her efficiency and
power. It is their main purpose to provide
the human fulcrum demanded by
those monstrous levers at the Docks, and
the strange motions of those engines are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
of a nature that inevitably leave the
flesh hideously excoriated and crushed.
The bedraggled humans whom we saw
running hither and thither among the
unhuman silences and uproars are drawn
almost wholly from the Slums, and it
is, quite undisguisedly, the incalculable
necessities of those silences and uproars
that have condemned them to the slums
and kept them prisoned there.</p>

<p>For it is not that the wage of a dock-labourer
is insufficient to grant life its
decencies. It would, on the contrary, be
quite possible for a dock-labourer, constantly
employed, to live in one of the
suburbs&mdash;out, say, at Seaforth&mdash;and
come to the wharves each day by electric
car. But the majority of these men are
not constantly employed, and much of
that inconstancy would seem to be inevitable.
Ships come, ships go, and the
tide of labour waxes and wanes as ceaselessly
as the tides about it, and vastly
more capriciously. And thus not more
than twenty-five per cent. of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>workers receive a full and constant
wage; quite fifty per cent. average less
than one-half; and fully a quarter are
fortunate if they are permitted to work
a couple of days a week. For the greater
number of these ministers to Liverpool’s
efficiency, then, the Slums, obviously,
are inevitable. Equally inevitably, the
Slums form a topographical annexe to
the Docks, a hinterland behind its gates.
Out of the bodies of the battered and
congested people who crowd there Liverpool
contrives a suave unguent, more
dreadful than adipocere, which enables
the great ships to slide so smoothly to
their berths.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 2.</h3>

<p>That, then, is the first broad feature
of Liverpool’s poverty&mdash;the frankness
and completeness with which it is involved
in the processes which grant her
all her wealth. I have already spoken
of its physical distribution: two dirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
smears, one on either hand of the clean-swept
central spaces. Of the two, the
northern is the larger; and together
they probably contain some six thousand
adults and some thirteen thousand
children. Of these (and this is the
second and more interior peculiarity), the
majority are either Irish or of Irish
descent.<a name="Anchor_5" id="Anchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5.">[5]</a> It follows, therefore, that here
alone in Liverpool do you get a specific
dialect. They speak a bastard brogue:
a shambling, degenerate speech of slipshod
vowels and muddied consonants&mdash;a
cast-off clout of a tongue, more debased
even than Whitechapel Cockney, because
so much more sluggish, so much less
positive and acute. It follows, too, that
the ruling religion of these quarters is
Roman Catholicism. There are about a
dozen Catholic churches actually in the
Slums, and to pass suddenly into one of
them out of the stench and uproar of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
dishevelled court is to taste again, in a
very peculiar measure, the sweet, rich
silence that has so often broken on one’s
palate in the towns and villages of the
Continent. Here, as on the Continent,
too, the people slip in and out all day
long, genuflecting, sitting in apathetic
huddles, going back once more to their
sorrowful outer world. And you constantly
see the figures of priests moving
to and fro among the lanes and alleys.</p>

<h3 title="">§ 3.</h3>

<p>It would be an easy matter to add
to this list of the region’s peculiarities: to
speak of its food&mdash;chiefly bread and tea,
with, upon occasion, the viler parts of pig;
of its queer parasitic industries; of its
dress, its habit of early marriage, its
extravagant fecundity. But to do this
would be simply to repeat, with a difference,
that oldest and unhappiest of slum-induced
habits, the habit of regarding
the people who live there as, in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
sort, a race apart. We speak largely of
the Underworld, the People of the Abyss,
the Submerged Tenth, and gradually we
drift into a way of considering them as a
strange breed of degenerates, mattoids,
morlocks.... It is an offence that all
the friendships I have formed amongst
these people make me especially anxious
to avoid. They are all, really, much
more like the suburbans than the suburbans
are themselves. Each one of these
so bedraggled humans is really a rinsed
and expurgated bundle of just those
passions and emotions which form the
unalterable nucleus of every character in
the world. Life for them, you see, is so
astonishingly shorn of the complexities
and elaborations. All its circumstances&mdash;those
levers at the Docks amongst
others&mdash;have tended to fine everything
down to the blunt, primary facts; and
it is here, accordingly, and not amongst
the lettuce-eaters who read Nietzsche in
lonely country cottages, that you may
discover the authentic simple life. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
are always undisguisedly face to face,
for instance, with that most ancient and
inveterate of human problems, the problem
of getting food. They start, so to
say, from scratch. They tear the day’s
vitality out of their own vitals. They
know the pains of hunger on the one
hand, the pains of satisfying hunger on
the other; and they are constantly preoccupied
with the fundamental human
business of reconciling that great antithesis.
It is the same throughout.
Birth and Death, Hunger, Love and
Hate, the Terrors of Damnation and the
Hope of Heaven, become constant and
vehement companions. The bones of
life show through. Here, certainly, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plus
ça change plus c’est la même chose</i>. And
the people who live here are simply our
simplified selves.</p>

Blenheim Street&mdash;quite one of the most
malodorous corners in the whole of Liverpool’s
Underworld. Her father (like so
many of the fathers here: they seem to
wear rather worse than the women) is
dead, and Esther keeps herself and a
vile-tempered, rheumaticky old gargoyle-crowned
stick of a mother by tramping
amazing distances through the northern
suburbs&mdash;Anfield, Kirkdale, and so on&mdash;selling
“stuff.” “Stuff” is Liverpool
Irish for cheap fruits and vegetables, and
she carries her ill-favoured tomatoes or
oranges or whatever it may be in a great
basket poised on a turban perched on
the top of her head. Also, she bellows.
By getting to the market by six in the
morning and steadily walking and bellowing
until five o’clock at night she can
sometimes make quite as much as twelve
shillings a week, which is more than she
used to make in the tin-works. (It was
Mr. Upton Sinclair, by the way, who
really expelled her from there. “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
Jungle” had some unsuspected sequels
in this and that odd corner of the world.)
She wears one of those local accretions
of innumerable petticoats which so successfully
attain all a crinoline’s ugliness
without any of its precision, and her
mass of red hair is scraped back into a
tumbling knot above her neck, and drawn
over the forehead of her pointed face in
a broad fringe. She speaks the hideous
jargon of the district, and when the
suburban sees her in his own streets thus
fringed, petticoated, bawling, and besmeared,
he very naturally wonders what
kind of preposterous nature must lurk
beneath so preposterous an exterior.</p>

<p>But I know Esther very well indeed,
and I protest that she is not in the least
preposterous, that she is not, essentially,
anything but particularly normal. I am
convinced, indeed, as Grant Allen was
of Hedda Gabler, that “I take her in
to dinner twice a week.” She has all
the essential, the root qualities: she is
just, she is generous, she is sociable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
She loves cleanliness and good colours.
She has a fine appetite for pleasure, and
the right, needful touch of <i>diablerie</i>. All
that she lacks is an adequate mode of
expression, the flexile, elaborate technique
which would enable her to grant
these things a gracious and orderly
embodiment.... If you could invest
her with certain possibilities of dress
(the dress that Mr. Charles Ricketts
designed the other day for Miss McCarthy
would suit her admirably), could get her
hair heaped up and back, and so round
across her forehead in the curve that
would rhyme with the feat curve of her
chin, she would present, if not a figure
of intolerable beauty, at least one of
very singular vividness and charm....
Well, just in the same way with that
essential bundle of root qualities which
she possesses: grant them a similar
appropriate equipment, and you would
get an equally delightful result. But
as it is, hammered out on the patched
and tuneless instrument she has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
provided with, all the fine human music
of which she is so full sounds fearfully
like so much deliberate discordancy.
Her sociability, for instance: she is
compelled to express that by sitting on
a sour doorstep in the midst of a raucous
group of messy neighbours. Her affection,
again: she can only display that
by lovingly cursing her mother, and by
swinking all day on her behalf instead
of getting married&mdash;as she so easily
might do. She is just; but perhaps the
only dignified example of her justness
that I can produce is her remark (remember,
she is one of the devoutest of
Catholics) that probably the folks who
insist upon leaving tracts for her really
mean very well at bottom. She is fond
of cleanliness; and the proof of that is
to be found in the fact that she spends
vastly more pains upon her toilet than
many even second-rate actresses. It is
not her fault that the results are incommensurate
with her efforts. When one
has to get all the water one uses from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
little dribbling pump in the middle of a
filthy court; when one has to carry it in
a leaky meat-tin up a slimy stairway to a
fœtid room; when one has to wash
(without soap) in the same meat-tin, and
do one’s fringe without a looking-glass;
when one has to do all this on a diet
of bread and tea, and under a constant
hail of reproaches from a rheumaticky
old gargoyle, then it becomes distinctly
easy to expend an enormous amount of
energy without obtaining any very
ravishing result. The result in Esther’s
case is that you get an apparition so
preposterous and streaky that well-meaning
old ladies in the public streets
are often moved to remonstrate with it
on the subject of untidiness. I have
heard them. I have also heard Esther’s
replies.... She has, as I say, the needful
touch of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">diablerie</i>.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 5.</h3>

<p>As with Esther, so with the majority
of those about her. They are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
plaster saints, and they are not morlocks:
they are simply a community of amiably-intentioned
life and laughter loving men
and women and children, with the
average amount of pluck and the average
amount of cowardice, all exceedingly
human and sinful and lovable and
amorous and faithful and absurd and
vain, and all compelled, by some strange
swirl of outer circumstance, to spend
their strength in a warfare waged on
prehistoric lines. Here and there, of
course, the skin self-protectingly toughens,
malformities creep in, the Beast gets its
appalling opportunities. Those levers at
the Docks produce some sickening results....
But I do not want to heap
up horrors. That, indeed, would be an
easy thing to do. But it is even easier
to misunderstand those exterior horrors
which constantly do present themselves.
That dirt, as we have seen, does not
mean a love of dirt or a lack of energy;
it simply stands for lack of proper tools.</p>

<p>Those clustered slatterns on the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>steps
do not really symbolize degeneracy;
they merely emblematize that delicate
and wholesome spirit which finds its
projection elsewhere in the pleasant
devices of our drawing-rooms. That
ghastly uproar in a place of stench and
wailing children simply means that the
spleen which you and I, armed with a
host of ingenious little instruments, twist
and contrive into this and that elaborate
code of moods and attitudes, is there
being published abroad in the only
fashion available. And it is not the
fault of these people, nor in the least their
essential desire, it is wholly the fault of
the uncouth apparatus at their disposal,
that their embodiment of that other
wholesome and delicate human instinct&mdash;the
instinct for Pleasure&mdash;should have
taken the form of the crude lights and
shocks of a corner tavern.</p>

<p>No, down here in the blackness and
the slime, it is not, for the most part,
any strange, incalculable brood that has
its spawning-place; and I would like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
these two regions to remain in your
imagination rather as a couple of far,
unwholesome islands, primitive with
jungle and morass, on which some
thousands of twentieth century civilians,
bankrupt of even the necessities, have
been planked astonishingly down.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 6.</h3>

<p>Now, it is obviously not in the nature
of things that Liverpool should permit
all the resultant discordancies and malformities&mdash;the
constant waste of effort,
the constant and preposterous clothing
of civil bodies in a barbarous dress&mdash;without
making some very notable efforts
to provision and equip those islands.
Much of this black disorder forms, as I
have said, a large part of the price she
pays for her efficiency&mdash;these people have
been marooned here by the necessities
of her own prosperous voyages&mdash;and
although her passion for efficiency will
never permit her to reduce the blackness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
by decreasing the efficiency, that very
passion has always made her supremely
anxious to beat down the price as far
as possible. In no other city in the
country, certainly, have the questions
of feeding the poor, of housing them,
nursing them, washing them, received
more earnest and controlled attention;
and upon the shores of these strange
islands far-sounding official tides are
constantly flinging this and that of
necessity, of comfort, of direction. Into
the details of all these efforts I have now
no space to enter; nor, indeed, would
such entry fall within the scope of this
book. But you get their presence
visualized, you get the vital sense of the
activity of all these forces, when you
turn some drab corner among the hovels
and the rank disorder and come suddenly
in sight of one of the clean, decisive
blocks of Corporation dwellings: leash,
personable structures, balconied and
symmetrical, made up of course upon
course of fit and habitable flats, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
glittering at night with an unexpected
blithesomeness and order. You get the
same assurance, again, in the public
wash-houses planted here and there&mdash;the
first of their kind in the kingdom;
and again in the occurrence of those
neat-handed depots for distributing
sterilized milk which dot a white pattern
all about the blackness.</p>

<p>And always about these coasts, augmenting
the gifts of the controlled official
tides, there constantly wheels and dips
an active fleet of friendly privateers. It
is to them, indeed, that one’s natural
inclination is always to look most hopefully:
they are obviously human, they
bring camaraderie and affection&mdash;needful
things that the milk depots are not compelled
to supply. You get all that side
of the thing admirably symbolized by
those open-air concerts (also, I fancy, the
first of their sort in the kingdom) organized
by one of the most successful of
these free-lance expeditions, which fill
the darkest of the courts, night after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
night, with actual, colourful music....
So that all these islanders, Esther and
the rest, are not to be pictured as
living in absolute isolation. Through
the chaotic crowd of them there constantly
move, very vitally and wonderfully,
certain reassuring visitants&mdash;some
shrewd, some benignant, some sentimental,
but all enormously in earnest;
and for my own part I never recall the
dull bleared speech that prevails there
without hearing, too, the dainty broken
English, the daintier laughter, of a certain
Swiss worker who chaffs them and
mothers them and bullies them, and
whom they love exceedingly, or without
seeing the spare figure of that fine
Founder of a noble secular order whom
seven thousand children know by name,
and who can pass anywhere among these
morasses, at any hour of the day or
night, and receive nothing but a welcome
of elemental friendliness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>


</div>
<div>
<h3 title="">§ 7.</h3>

<p>So that, in one way and another, the
islanders begin to get their apparatus,
the People of the Abyss, if you prefer to
call them so, their share of light and
laughter; and some day, perhaps, these
two dull smears may even be wholly
erased. And one speaks of such an
event with the more of hopefulness
because there are not lacking certain
signals of a wide and deep change that
is about to pass over, that has, indeed,
already begun to pass over, the great
organism of which they form so intimate
a part. I do not speak now of a mere
change in the social attitude towards
these people; I speak rather of those
profounder alterations of character, of
purpose, of ideal, which must run their
apparently unrelated course before any
such specific attitude can be affected at
all stably and significantly. All this
blackness and disarray is, after all, too
fundamental to vanish before any self-conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
and deliberate endeavours; it
can only disappear by a kind of accident,
the almost unintended by-product of
other and alien processes; and it is,
therefore, neither to the efforts of these
fine workers, nor to the validity and zeal
of that glittering official machinery, that
one turns, on the last analysis, for the
true portents of the change. It is rather
to the talk going on in the cafés, to the
books in the booksellers’ windows, to the
remote suburban firesides where very
different matters are being quietly discussed,
to the efforts apparent in the
ateliers. And in all these places, it
seems to me, there are to be discerned
the signs of the dawn of another epoch
in the City’s history.</p>

<p>Liverpool passes out of her pubescence.
The swift straight lines of her eager and
yet so strangely dignified uprising begin
to swerve out now into ample curves,
begin to enclose another spaciousness, a
larger and more considerate leisure. One
finds it evidenced in the social atmosphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
of the place, in an increasing suavity and
ripeness to be discovered there. It appears
again in the part played by the
University&mdash;a part of ever-increasing
confidence and intimacy on the one hand,
of ever-increasing acceptability on the
other. It is to be detected in the religious
life of the place, in the aspirations
which surround the great Cathedral which
is now splendidly uprising in her midst.
It is disclosed in the revealing mirror of
the arts. In her latest and most perfect
piece of architecture, the luminous building,
so significantly isolated, that serenely
dominates her central wharves, she seems,
almost for the first time, to have confessed
herself in beauty perfectly, and
she has done that because the nature
of the confession had already suffered
change. A new poet, too, has wonderfully
arisen in the midst of these hitherto
almost songless workers; and in the
painters’ quarters there is a momentous
stir of schism and disputation. Already
the old art of the place, called into existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
by its spirit of independence, but
limited by the typical demands of so
strenuous an atmosphere, begins to give
way a little before the advances of an
art that concedes nothing to the citizen,
that sits frankly apart among its own
visions.... In a little bronze-hung
studio, poised high above one of the
central ways, a woman is dealing with
pigment in a fashion more sensitive and
personal than any that has been known
in Liverpool before. Well, in the quality
of her work I find some confession of the
forces that are producing the profound
unanimous change which may lead,
among other things, to the dispersal of
the darkness of the underworld.</p>

<p>So that in the end this dull stain may
vanish. I have called it a dream&mdash;a
black mood out of which the City dreadfully
gathers inspiration for her battles.
Like other dreams, it may one day draw
to its close. But when it is over the
dreamer, too, will have changed; that,
at least, is inevitable. Just in what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
manner these subtle and various mutations
will affect her character, her aspect,
it is impossible even to suggest. It may be
that this growing sensitiveness will soften
in some measure the fingers we have seen
probing, so tirelessly, so tirelessly, for
the hard unmitigable fact. Or it may
be that she will discover some wonderful
union between these qualities, will maintain
a double dominion, losing nothing
of her ardour, gaining much of this new
tranquillity. It is impossible to predict.
This much alone is certain: that the
next book which essays her portraiture
will have to deal with a strangely different
subject.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>

<p>For additional contact information:</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
